"August 18, 2023","The President's News Conference with President Yoon Suk Yeol of the Republic of Korea and Prime Minister Kishida Fumio of Japan at Camp David, Maryland","
PRESIDENT BIDEN: Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Camp David.
If I seem like I'm happy, it's because I am. (Laughter.) This has been a great, great meeting.
Mr. President, Mr. Prime Minister, I -- we meet in this historic place to make a historic moment. And I believe that to be true. The -- this is a new era in partnership between Japan, the Republic of Korea, and the United States -- our new Camp David trilat. (Laughs.) That's what we have here.
And -- but before we dive into the progress we've made today -- if you excuse, we used to say in the Senate, ""a point of personal privilege"" -- I want to start by expressing my appreciation for the contribution that your countries have made toward the relief following the devastating wildfires in Hawaii. I want to thank you both on behalf of the American people.
I also want to note that my team is closely monitoring Hurricane Hilary, which is -- has the potential to bring significant rain and flooding to southern California. FEMA has pre-positioned personnel and supplies in the region, and they're ready to respond as needed. I urge everyone -- everyone in the path of this storm to take precautions and listen to the guidance from state and local officials.
And you've heard me say it before: The Republic of Korea and Japan are capable and indispensable allies.
Now, to the purpose of why we're here.
America's commitment to both countries is ironclad, and my personal commitment to bringing these three nations together was real from the very beginning.
Since last summer, we've met on the margins of the NATO Summit in Spain, the ASEAN Summit in Cambodia, and the G7 Summit in Japan. And today, we've made history with the first-ever standalone summit between the leaders of our three countries, as well as our commitment to meet together on the leader level annually and to have all of our relative Cabinet-member people meet on a regular basis for -- from this point on; not just this year, not next year -- forever. That's the i- -- that's the intention.
And so, I want to recognize the important work that both of you have done and the political courage -- and I mean this sincerely -- the political courage that you've both demonstrated to resolve difficult issues that would've stood in the way for a long time of a close relationship between Japan and Korea and with the United States.
Your leadership, with the full support of the United States, has brought us here, because each of you understands that our world stands at an inflection point -- a point where we're called to lead in new ways: to work together, to stand together. And today, I'm proud to say our nations are answering that call.
First, we're elevating our trilateral defense collaboration to deliver in the Indo-Pacific region. That includes launching annual multidomain military exercises, bringing our trilateral defense cooperation to an unprecedented levels.
We're doubling down on information sharing, including on the DPRK's missile launches and cyber activities, strengthening our ballistic missile defense cooperation.
And, critically -- critically, we've all committed to swiftly consult with each other in response to threats to any one of our countries from whatever source it occurs. That means we'll have a hotline to share information and coordinate our responses whenever there is a crisis in the region or affecting any one of our countries.
And today, we've reaffirmed -- all reaffirmed our shared commitment to maintaining peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait and addressing ec- -- and addressing economic coercion.
We're going to continue to counter threats from the DPRK, including cryptocurrency money laundering to the tune of billions of dollars; potential arms transfer in support of Russia's brutal war against Ukraine.
And together -- together, we're going to stand up for international law, freedom of navigation, and the peaceful resolution of disputes in the South China Sea.
Second, we're expanding our economic cooperation to build an Ino -- an Indo-Pacific that is peaceful and prosperous.
Today, we've committed to launch a new -- what we call a ""Supply Chain Early Warning System"" -- excuse me, a Supply Chain Early Warning System Pilot and -- which will alert our nations to disruptions of certain products and materials, like critical minerals or batteries, so we can get ahead of the issues as we -- they appear with the experience -- that we've experienced in -- during the pandemic.
(Referring to a piece of audio equipment.) Excuse me, this is falling off. There you go.
And -- and building on the G7-led Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment, we're deepening cooperation between our development finance institutions to mobilize more financing for quality infrastructure and secure communications technology to help low-income and middle-income countries throughout the region take on the challenges that matter most to their people.
And finally, our partnership is about building a better future for our people. That's why we're deepening our cooperation on global health and launching a trilateral expert exchange in support of the U.S. Cancer Moonshot initiative. That's going to, I believe, change cancer as we know it.
It matters a great deal to me and to families all across our three countries. In the United States, we are revolutionizing the way we do cancer research. And together, the three of us, I am confident we can harness our shared spirit of innovation and end cancer as we know it.
We're also launching a new collaboration between our National Laboratories and advance our science knowledge and technological capabilities together. As we do, we'll work in lockstep to set the standards for safe, secure, and trustworthy emerging technology, including artificial intelligence, which a lot of work has to be done on.
Let me close with this. Mr. President, Mr. Prime Minister, this is the first summit I've hosted at Camp David as President. I can think of no more fitting location to begin the next era -- our next era of cooperation -- a place that has long symbolized the power of new beginnings and new possibilities.
In the months and years ahead, we're going to continue to seize those possibilities together -- unwavering in our unity and unmatched in our resolve. This is not about a day, a week, or month. This is about decades and decades of relationships that we're building.
Mr. Prime Minister and Mr. President, I want to thank you for your leader, and I -- leadership -- and I say it again -- for your courage that brought us together. And I look forward to working with you both of you ahead.
Now I yield to -- who am I yielding to?
MODERATOR: Distinguished guests --
PRESIDENT BIDEN: There you go.
MODERATOR: -- the President of the Republic of Korea.
PRESIDENT BIDEN: We needed the voice of God to tell us that. (Laughter.)
PRESIDENT YOON: (As interpreted.) First of all, I'd like to thank President Biden for his warm hospitality. It is a great pleasure to visit Camp David along with Prime Minister Kishida. Camp David is a site that bears historical significance where important diplomatic decisions were made at critical junctures of modern history.
In order to respond to today's unprecedented polycrisis, the ties between our three countries, which are the most advanced liberal democracies in the region and major economies leading advanced technology and scientific innovation, are more important than ever.
From this moment on, Camp David will be remembered as a historic place where the Republic of Korea, the United States, and Japan proclaimed that we will bolster the rules-based international order and play key roles to enhance regional security and prosperity based on our shared values of freedom, human rights, and rule of law.
Today, we, the three leaders, held the very first standalone trilateral summit marking a new chapter in our trilateral cooperation. Today, we have agreed on the Camp David principles that will function as the enduring guidelines for our trilateral cooperation. In addition, we have developed the Spirit of Camp David, which is a document embodying the vision of our trilateral cooperation and ways to translate our will to cooperate into action.
First of all, to facilitate the stable development of our trilateral cooperation, we have built the institutional basis for the trilateral cooperation at multiple levels and sectors. In addition to making our trilateral summit regular, we have agreed to have our governments' personnel at all levels -- including foreign ministers, defense ministers, and national security advisors -- meet every year to closely coordinate our trilateral cooperation.
In particular, we, the three leaders, have agreed to establish a communication channel so we can swiftly coordinate and respond together in case an urgent issue occurs in the region.
Furthermore, to bolster our trilateral strategic cooperation in the Indo-Pacific, our three countries will establish the ROK, U.S., Japan Indo-Pacific dialogue, which will discover new areas of cooperation. Also, along with the economic security dialogue led by our three countries' NSCs, we have agreed to found a consultative body for development policy coordination and also build cooperation frameworks in various sectors including global health and women empowerment.
We have also decided to hold our ROK, U.S., and Japan Global Leadership Youth Summit to strengthen ties between our future generations.
Second, we have agreed to step up our security cooperation to ensure our people's safety and peace in the region based on the now institutionalized Cooperation Framework.
First of all, to this end, we have consulted on practical ways to cooperate, aimed at improving our joint response capabilities to North Korea's nuclear and missile threats, which have become sophisticated more than ever. The real-time sharing of DPRK missile warning data, which was agreed upon during the Phnom Penh summit last November, will be activated within this year. And this will make a significant progress in strengthening our three nations' capabilities to detect and track North Korea's missiles.
In countering the DPRK's nuclear and missile threats, we concurred the trilateral defense exercises were crucial. As such, annual plans will be established for the ROK, U.S., Japan drills we committed to.
In the meantime, as North Korea funds its nuclear and missile programs by exploiting labor and human rights, efforts to monitor and stem such activities will be redoubled. To deter the DPRK's illicit funding activities, a new trilateral working group on DPRK cyber activities will be established.
Moreover, Korea, the U.S., and Japan, in their pursuit of Indo-Pacific strategies, oppose any unilateral attempts to change the status quo by force.
Respect for sovereignty, territorial integrity, the peaceful settlement of disputes, among others, undergird a rules-based international order that we resolve to safeguard by intensifying our collaboration.
As part of such endeavors, our three nations agreed to support ASEAN and Pacific Island countries with their maritime security capacity-building efforts.
Furthermore, to help Ukrainians regain freedom and pursue reconstruction, we are determined to increase our three-way coordination.
Next, we, the three leaders, discussed how to work together to promote shared prosperity and future growth. First of all, in the field of economic security directly linked to our national economies of the three countries, we will work to expand our strategic partnership.
To ensure global supply chain resilience and energy security, we pledged to bolster our trilateral cooperation. To manage global supply chain risks, an early warning system will be established together.
In addition, we decided to broaden our collaboration in the field of cutting-edge technologies to secure future growth engines. Specifically, in AI, quantum, bio, and next-generation telecommunications and space sectors, cooperation among our three countries will deliver powerful synergies.
Korea, the U.S., and Japan committed to have their national laboratories expand joint R&D and personnel exchanges, providing a cornerstone for the three countries' leadership in science and technology innovation.
Moreover, for the sake of shared prosperity in the Asia Pacific, in line with the needs of ASEAN and Pacific Island countries, effective support measures will be sought and implemented collectively.
Today, we, the three leaders, affirmed our commitment to the trilateral partnership towards a new era and possibilities thereof.
Grounded in the core values of freedom, human rights, and the rule of law, a strong alliance of values among Korea, the U.S., and Japan will help build a world that's more peaceful and prosperous by serving as a sturdy foundation.
Mr. President, I thank you once again for your hospitality. Next time, I hope that we will be reunited in the Republic of Korea.
Thank you. (Applause.)
MODERATOR: Distinguished guests, the Prime Minister of Japan.
PRESIDENT BIDEN: President.
PRIME MINISTER KISHIDA: (As interpreted.) Thank you. First of all, in Maui, Hawaii, wildfires caused devastating damage. I express my sympathy, and I really pray for the peace of those who have lost their lives.
In order to offer support, a total of $2 million worth of support by our country has been decided. And the full -- the relief for the affected people and for the earliest recovery of the affected areas, Japan will proactively do our contribution.
Today, I have visited Camp David, and the three of us have spent a truly meaningful time. I expressed my heartfelt gratitude to Joe for the kind invitation.
Together with Joe and President Yoon, this has been a precious opportunity for myself to further deepen the relationship of trust and confidence. For the first time ever, instead of in the sidelines of multilateral conferences, we have held the trilateral summit on a standalone basis.
Here at Camp David, numerous historical meetings have taken place. And it is a huge honor to have printed a fresh page in its history with this meeting.
The foundation of the trilateral collaboration are the solid, firm, bilateral relationships. The three of us have understood this more than anyone else and have executed our understanding in practice.
In January of this year, I visited the United States, and later, President Yoon visited Japan in March and then to the U.S. in April. And in May, I myself traveled to South Korea, and we have bolstered our mutual relationship.
At the moment, the free and open international order, based on the rule of law, is in crisis. Due to Russia's aggression of Ukraine, the international order is shaken from its foundation. The unilateral attempt to change the status quo by force in the East and South China Seas are continuing. And the nuclear and missile threat of North Korea is only becoming ever larger.
Under such circumstances, to make our trilateral strategic collaboration blossom and bloom is only logical and almost inevitable and is required in this era.
The three of us here today declare our determination to pioneer the new era of Japan, U.S., ROK partnership.
How we will advance the cooperation of our three countries going forward, I will discuss from three perspectives.
Firstly, the coordination between the Japan-U.S. and the U.S.-ROK alliances will be reinforced, and trilateral security cooperation will be brought to a new height.
At this meeting, we agreed to hold the Japan-U.S.-ROK multidomain joint exercises on an annual basis. Furthermore, regarding the real-time sharing of North Korea's missile warning information that we agreed last November, the initial steps have been implemented and an important first step has been advanced towards the launch of the mechanism by the end of the year.
We also agreed on the establishment of the working group on North Korea cyber activities, considered to be the source of finance for nuclear and missile development and on other matters.
The second point is the promotion of cooperation between the United States, Japan, and South Korea and the expansion of their areas of cooperation regarding the response to North Korea.
In addition to strengthening regional deterrence and response capabilities, the three countries agreed to strengthen cooperation for the full implementation of sanctions and to work closely together in the U.N. Security Council, where all three countries will be members in 2024.
At the same time, we shared our recognition that the way is open for dialogue with North Korea. I then stated that the abduction issue is a humanitarian issue with time constraints and once again received the strong support of Joe and President Yoon for the immediate resolution of this matter.
We also agreed to work together through the Indo-Pacific dialogue and the development cooperation to realize a free and open Indo-Pacific and, in particular, to coordinate capacity-building support in the domain of maritime security, particularly with regard to ASEAN and Pacific Island countries.
Furthermore, we agreed to promote cooperation in the field of economic security, including critical and emerging technologies and supply chain resilience.
Third, developing a framework for trilateral cooperation. This will create a foundation for continuous and stable enhancement of coordination among the three countries.
After confirming that the three countries will promote multi-layered cooperation at all levels, it was agreed that the trilateral summit meeting will be held at least once a year.
And likewise, the ministers of foreign affairs, defense, and national security advisors will each also meet at least once a year. And the financial minister, as well as the industry and commerce ministers, will be meeting.
We will consider the Camp David principles issued today at a historic turning point for the international community to be a new compass for trilateral cooperation, and we will vigorously implement the concrete cooperation outlined in the Camp David statement of Japan, ROK, and U.S. on our partnership.
Together with Joe and President Yoon, we will continue to work to further strengthen the strategic partnership between the three countries in order to safeguard a free and open international order based on the rule of law.
Thank you. (Applause.)
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Thank you. Now we have time for questions. President Biden, please select your reporter first.
PRESIDENT BIDEN: Aamer, with the AP.
Q: Thank you, Mr. President. I have a question for each of the leaders. They will be brief and -- but related.
President Biden, first for you: How confident should Asia be about a robust American commitment to a nuclear umbrella when the Compa- -- Commander-in-Chief who preceded you and is looking to succeed you spoke openly about reducing the U.S. footprint in the Korean Peninsula?
President Yoon, how much confidence can Japan and the U.S. have about Seoul's long-term commitment to rapprochement when polls show the solid majority of Korea disapproves of your handling and mending of the forced labor issue?
And, Prime Minister Kishida, what assurances can you give to your country's citizens who fear bolstering your security cooperation in this matter could lead to -- the country into an economic cold war with China?
And if you'll indulge me, Mr. President, on a domestic matter: What is your reaction to the Special Counsel appointment last week into your son?
Thank you.
PRESIDENT BIDEN: (Laughs.) Well, first of all, look, there's not much, if anything, I agree on with my predecessor on foreign policy. His America First policy, walking away from the rest of the world, has made us weaker, not stronger.
America is strong with our allies and our alliances, and that's why we will endure. And it's a strength that -- quite frankly, that increases all the -- three of our strengths.
This is just about one summit. What makes today different is it actually launches a series of initiatives that are actually institutional changes in how we deal with one another -- in security cooperation, economic cooperation, technology cooperation, development cooperation, consultation exercises. And all of this will create (inaudible) momentum, I believe, year by year, month by month, to make the relationship stronger and more certain to remain to be in place.
And with regard -- on these esult- -- results, I think you're going to keep it going. And I think you're going to benefit all our countries.
And with regard to the second question, I make -- I have no comment on any investigation that's going on. That's up to the Justice Department, and that's all I have to say.
PRESIDENT YOON: (As interpreted.) To the question that was directed to me, I would like to say that the treaty made between Korea and Japan that was made in 1965 and the following measures by the government and the Supreme Court's ruling in 2015 have some differences. But we have already implemented measures to bridge the gaps among them.
And in South Korea, of course, there is public opinion that is opposed to the government's measures like that. However, from a perspective that's forward-looking, strengthening ties and improving relationships between Korea and Japan are important and there is a shared understanding that this matters to our bilateral relationship, as well as our future. And this is something we need to continue working on.
PRIME MINISTER KISHIDA: (As interpreted.) Thank you for the question. First of all, at today's meeting, the rules-based international order and activities inconsistent to such rule-based international order and activities. Other concerns have been shared, and the rule-based, free and open international order must be defended. And going forward, the U.S., Japan, ROK strategic collaboration will be reinforced even further. Such endeavors will continue going forward.
Our country and for the surrounding countries, the response capabilities, as well as defense capabilities, will be bolstered. And by doing so, the lives and livelihood of our population will be protected and the sense of assurance must be raised. These are the important activities.
Having said that, with regard to China, last year, in November, there was the Japan-China Leaders Summit, and there was a positive momentum. By maintaining the positive momentum, what has to be asserted will be asserted. And we shall strongly request responsible conduct. And we will continue an accumulative conversation about multiple issues. We will cooperate with regard to common challenges. Such constructive and stable relationship will be established by mutual effort.
That is my administration's consistent policy. Based on this perception towards regional stability, our efforts will continue.
Thank you.
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: President Yoon, next question, please.
PRESIDENT YOON: (As interpreted.) Please go ahead and ask a question. The reporter from Money Today -- reporter named Jongjin Park. Please go ahead with your question.
Q: (As interpreted.) Hi, I'm Jongjin Park of Money Today. First of all, I would like to ask a question to President Yoon Suk Yeol of the Republic of Korea. I heard that you said that a new chapter has opened in our trilateral cooperation with the two countries. Compared to the previous summits, what would be the most significant outcome that you gained through this summit?
And also, from the perspective of our people, what would be the benefit that the people of Korea would feel from these strengthening of ties?
And now my question goes to President Biden. During this summit, the issues of detainees or prisoners of wars -- and you mentioned that there will be further cooperation in these human rights issues. And you also said you will support the free and peaceful Korean Peninsula in the region. And what kind of shift would there be in your policy? And what kind of specific solutions do you have in this regard?
Lastly, I would like to direct my question to Prime Minister Kishida. Today, we had a historic trilateral summit. However, there was much backlash and many concerns in Korea. However, President Yoon showed his political courage to do so. That's the international community's evaluation.
However, there are still concerns that Japan is making very passive efforts to resolve our issues that still remain. And also, how would you be able to show your truthful willingness to resolve and improve our bilateral relations going forward?
PRESIDENT YOON: (As interpreted.) First of all, this trilateral cooperation amongst our three countries has opened a new chapter, and we made that announcement today to talk about the differences from the past cooperation.
For instance, in the past, it was about individual issues that we sought cooperation among ourselves. But now, as we have opened a new chapter in our cooperation for security, economy, science and technology, and development cooperation for the Global South, health, and women -- across all of these issues, our three countries decided to closely work together. So it's much more comprehensive in nature.
Such comprehensive cooperation has been launched by us today because currently we face complicated crisis and the threat from the DPRK. And across the world, we believe that we can together make a contribution to freedom and peace around the world.
So that is our foundational understanding and our common and shared interests of the three countries. And not just for exclusionary interests of ourselves. Our interests are well aligned with the universal interests of the members of the global community. That's where we find our shared interests lie.
And at the same time, this framework of comprehensive cooperation among our three countries will contribute to global supply chain resilience, global financial market stability, cooperation in the frontier technology sectors and science.
Our three countries together have the best-in-class expertise in science and technology. And we are the ones who are implementing liberal democracies.
Naturally, progress in science and technologies will bring benefits -- tangible benefits to our people, not just in terms of security, but also in terms of economy and science and technology.
But what is most important here is not about our own interests only. When we put our forces together, I believe that we can make a contribution to the advancement of freedom and peace in the world. And that's exactly where our interests are aligned.
PRESIDENT BIDEN: I -- look, back in May of 2022, I met with the families of the Japanese abductees during my visit, heard their stories, and empathized with them and got a sense of the pain they're feeling. It's real.
We know there are many families out there who still wait and worry and wonder. We're not going to forget about them or their loved ones.
And there's clear language on this on our joint statement. The bottom line is this: that we share a common position. We're committed to working together to see the return of all prisoners of war and -- and those who've been abducted and detained.
And by the way, one of the things we get asked many times -- and it wasn't directly asked, but implied -- is what makes us think any of this is positive.
Success brings success. When other nations see cooperation in the region, they make judgments about: Would they be better off if they made commitments? Will they move?
Think about -- as students of history, all of you -- and you are -- think about how many times successes have generated other successes when you don't anticipate it.
And so, I -- I just think this is a -- we're not going to forget, we're not giving up, and we're going to continue to make the case for the freedom of all of those detainees.
PRIME MINISTER KISHIDA: (As interpreted.) With regard to your question for me, first of all, I have strong feelings about strengthening bilateral relationships between the ROK and Japan. I share that with President Yoon. The two countries, in dealing with international challenges, should cooperate. We're both important neighboring countries. And so, friendship with President Yoon and a relationship of trust, based on this, both countries as partners should open up a new era. And that is my thinking.
This year, President Yoon came to Japan, and I visited the ROK. At international fora, we have repeated meetings -- we have had repeated meetings. And between our two countries, including the economy and security, we've had forward-looking and concrete approaches which were started. It's already in motion, dynamically.
Economic security dialogue was started -- or it has been decided on. In the area of export control, there have been progress. And also financial ministers and defense ministers have had meetings.
And so, we've had this very positive, forward-looking developments. And these are seen not only in the public sector. Also in the private sector, we see a slate of developments, human exchanges, and exchanges between business circles. We're seeing very active developments in all of these areas, and that is a reality.
Going forward, we hope to accumulate these approaches along with President Yoon to strengthen our bilateral relations even further. By generating results, we hope that people will understand Japan's feelings towards our bilateral relations. And we'd like to continue such efforts.
Thank you.
Thank you very much. Then, let me see. From Kyodo -- Tajiri-san, Kyodo News.
Q: (As interpreted.) Tajiri, Kyodo News. At Camp David with history. I do have a question to each of the leaders.
President Biden, it was mentioned at this summit meeting that Russia's aggression of Ukraine is continuing. So, what role do you expect of Japan?
Prime Minister Kishida has mentioned that as China's threat in Asia is rising, Ukraine may be East Asia tomorrow. What do you think about this comment, President Biden?
And the situation in Asia, where China's threat is rising -- what is the meaning and significance of the trilateral relationship with Japan, U.S., ROK becoming stronger in multiple layers?
President Yoon Suk Yeol, I have a question to Your Excellency. North Korea's nuclear missile development is a major security threat to Japan, South Korea, and the U.S. As North Korea's provocations continue to escalate, what is the meaning and significance of the three countries declaring a new era of partnership?
Regarding the release of treated water at Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant, did Prime Minister Kishida explain the matter at the trilateral or the bilateral summit today?
To the recent Japan-ROK summit meeting, Your Excellency, you expressed your intent to respect the IAEA report despite the strong domestic opposition. Why do you demonstrate your understanding for the policy of Kishida administration? I ask for that reason.
And to Prime Minister Kishida, this is the first time that a trilateral summit is held on a standalone basis rather than on the sidelines of international meetings. You have said that the trilateral cooperation will be raised to new heights for the security environment in East Asia. And without the resolution of abduction, North Korea is continuing nuclear missile development. What is the meaning for North Korea?
And in eastern South China Seas, by maritime advancement, China is continuing unilateral attempts to change the status quo. What is the meaning for China?
PRESIDENT BIDEN: And you have a great imagination. One question ends up being six. But, thank you. I'll try to answer all of it. (Laughter.) I'm glad I didn't have you as my law professor when he said ""one question."" (Laughs.) At any rate, they're all legitimate questions.
Look, on Ukraine, I and my country and the leadership of my country in both parties are very grateful for everything Japan is helping to deal with in Ukraine. And I mean that sincerely. You've showed strong leadership through the G7 as well and contributed to a significant amount of financial and humanitarian assistance to Ukraine, as well as nonlethal military equipment.
And, you know -- and they joined so many other nations in holding Russia accountable through their international sanctions.
If my memory serves me well -- and I think it does, Mr. Prime Minister -- we found ourselves in a circumstance where, when I called you about Ukraine, I didn't have to convince you of anything. I started off to make the case that Ukraine was a circumstance where -- to think, in the first quarter of the 20th century, another country would amass over 150,000 forces on the border of another country -- or 150,000 forces and invade that country -- invade that country without any rationale other than -- if you read Putin's speech after he invaded, he talked about Kyiv being the motherland. You know, I mean, it just was ridiculous, I think. And he talked about being Peter the Great. It was --
Just imagine if we had done nothing. Imagine if we had done nothing.
And the point was immediately recognized, if I'm not mistaken, by you, Mr. Prime Minister, that we're
in a situation where it could happen anywhere. If we stand -- if we had stood still, what signal would that send to China about Taiwan? What signal would that send around the world if nations weren't powerful on borders?
But here's the deal. You contributed significantly to what, I think, is already the --
Let me put it this way. Russia has already lost. It cannot meet its original objective which it stated. It's not possible.
But -- and they've joined so many other nations in holding Russia accountable for international sanctions. But Japan's leadership, from day one, it has been critical for making it clear that the consequences for war extend well beyond Europe -- well beyond Europe.
I say it in reverse. What would happen if an Asian country with 150,000 troops invaded another? You think that would not affect the interests, the economy, and -- and the foreign policy of nations in Europe and Latin America all across the world? It would have profound impact.
And with Japan's leadership, from day one, it has been critical to making clear the consequences of this will extend well beyond Europe -- well beyond Europe. It's a global issue that has impacts everywhere. And the Prime Minister's comments at Shangri La capture that.
And by the way, you know, we talked about this being an inflection point. The world is changing. The world is changing. And about every six or seven generations, it makes significant change. And there's a lot happening.
And the idea that we're going to sit down, the rest of the world, and say, ""Well, that's only a European problem."" There hasn't been that kind of invasion since World War Two.
And so -- as for peace, we all want that, of course. Ukrainians want it most of all. And my team has been working very closely with the -- President Zelenskyy's team and further peace formula, noting that ""nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine.""
But nonetheless, we're meeting with them constantly -- constantly.
And your other two questions about China -- I'll just say this: This summit was not about China. That was not the purpose of the meeting. But it did come -- China obviously came up. Not to say we don't share concerns about the economic coercion or heightened tensions caused by China, but this summit was really about our relationship with each other and deepening cooperation across an entire range of issues that went well beyond just the immediate issues we raised.
It was about more peaceful and prosperous Indo-Pacific -- a region, quite frankly, that would benefit everyone living there and around the world if we get it right. It's not just here. It has a phenomenal impact.
Think about what's -- at any rate, I won't get going. I'll take too long.
But as you've seen from the initiatives we're announcing here, today is just how committed we are to see this vision take place. And I think this relationship that we put together and I think we're going to -- you're going to see it expand. It's not merely what we did today. This is a historic meeting.
But we're about to -- we've laid in place a long-term structure for a relationship that will last and have a phenomenal impact not just in Asia, but around the world.
Someone once said in a different context that -- about a health- -- a healthcare provision in my country a while ago: This is a big deal. This is a big deal.
Thank you.
Q: President Biden, how soon do you anticipate meeting with President Xi --
PRESIDENT BIDEN: They have to answer their questions.
PRESIDENT YOON: (As interpreted.) Yes, let me address the questions directed to me.
First, as to North Korea's nuclear and missile provocations and the threats that are posed and how we plan to counter those threats together among our three countries, let me address that question.
Of the cooperative frameworks among our three countries is the most -- what is most symbolic out of those is our cooperation in defense area. Any provocations or attacks against any one of our three countries will trigger a decision-making process of this trilateral framework, and our solidarity will become even stronger and harder.
And at the same time, missile information will be shared in a real-time basis, and systematic training and drills will be implemented in accordance with systematic annual schedules, regular schedules, and regular trainings that we plan to carry out together against the DPRK's missile provocations. That will be our response.
And at the same time, regarding your question concerning the water release from the Fukushima plant, as a matter of fact, that issue was not addressed during our summit because it was not on the agenda.
But still, let me try to address that question. The Fukushima plant's treated water, if it's going to have some type of impact, it would flow through the entire Pacific Ocean having an impact not just on our three countries, but all countries around the world.
As such, for the sake of safety and health of the people of our three countries and all members of the international community, that should be something that we need to place the highest priority on.
Regarding this treated water, based on scientific principles, all of the processing should be carried out accordingly. And at the same time, internationally recognized and reliable IAEA's investigation results are something that we can trust.
And I would like to make sure that everything is conducted and carried out in accordance with the procedures established by the IAEA. Together with the international community and also together with the Koreans, transparent data disclosure would be necessary, in my opinion.
PRIME MINISTER KISHIDA: (As interpreted.) Thank you. The question to myself. As you mentioned, nuclear and missile development by North Korea or unilateral attempts to change the status quo in the East and South China Seas are ongoing. And the security environment surrounding our three countries, it has becoming increasingly harsh day after day.
Under this backdrop, on this occasion, we agreed to enhance the coordination between the U.S.-Japan and the U.S.-ROK alliances and to bring the trilateral security cooperation to new heights.
This is indeed the requirement of this era. And by this summit, I am sure that the trilateral security cooperation will further advance and reinforce the regional peace and stability.
In particular, with regard to North Korea, we were able to put forward concrete results, such as the implementation of annual Japan, U.S, ROK multidomain and joint exercises and the establishment of a working group to address North Korea's cyber activities.
I also stated that the abduction issue is a humanitarian issue with time constraints. And Joe and President Yoon reiterated their strong support for the immediate resolution of this matter.
We also shared our recognition that the path to dialogue with North Korea is open.
Furthermore, once again, the presidents of both countries aligned with me in strongly opposing unilateral changes to the status quo through the use of force.
We will continue our efforts to further strengthen the strategic partnership among the three countries in order to defend the free, open, and international order based on the rule of law.
That is all. Thank you.
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: This concludes --
PRESIDENT BIDEN: To answer your question, I expect and hope to follow up on our conversation on Bali this fall. That's my expectation. Thank you.
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: This concludes our press conference. Please -- please stay seated as the -- the leaders depart, please. Please stay seated.
Q: Mr. President, are you winning the competition with China?
PRESIDENT BIDEN: We're winning all the competition.

"August 18, 2023","Remarks Prior to a Meeting with President Yoon Suk Yeol of the Republic of Korea and Prime Minister Kishida Fumio of Japan at Camp David, Maryland","
PRESIDENT BIDEN: Well, welcome, everyone. Mr. Prime Minister, Mr. President, it's an honor to welcome you both here today to inaugurate the Camp David trilateral between our three nations -- among our three nations.
It's not only the first summit I've hosted at Camp David, it's the first-ever standalone summit between the leaders of Japan and Republic of Korea and the United States.
And I can think of no better way -- no better way to mark our new chapter of our trilateral cooperation than meeting here at Camp David.
And so, strengthening the ties between our democracies has long been a priority for me, dating back to when I was vice president of the United States. That's because our countries are stronger and the world is safer -- let me say that again --our countries are stronger and the world will be safer as we stand together. And I know this is a belief we all three share.
And I want to thank you both for your political courage that brought you here. And I'm looking forward to us having a great meeting, but continuing these meetings.
You've stepped up to do the hard work -- the, I would argue, historic work -- to forge a foundation from which we can face the future together -- the three of us together.
And I'm deeply grateful for your leadership, and I look forward to working with both of you as we begin this new era of cooperation and renew our resolve to serve as a force of good across the Indo-Pacific and, quite frankly, around the world as well.
President Yoon, let me turn this over to you.
PRESIDENT YOON: (As interpreted.) I would like to extend my gratitude to President Biden for his warm hospitality. Last July, we met in Vilnius for the NATO Summit, and I'm pleased to be reunited in about a month.
At this symbolic venue of Camp David in the history of modern diplomacy, our trilateral partnership is opening a new chapter, which carries great significance, in my view.
President Roosevelt once stated: Freedom is not a given but something you fight to win. To make sure that each of our freedoms is neither threatened or damaged, our three nations must tighten our solidarity. Such is also our promise and mandate towards our future generations.
The stronger coordination between Korea, the U.S., and Japan requires more robust institutional foundations. Moreover, challenges that threaten regional security must be addressed by us building a stronger commitment to working together.
Today will be remembered as a historic day where we established a firm institutional basis and commitments to the trilateral partnership.
Today, I hope we will explore together ways to elevate cooperation between Korea, the U.S., and Japan to a new plane through in-depth discussions.
PRIME MINISTER KISHIDA: (As interpreted.) First of all, I would like to express my sympathy once again for the devastating damages caused by the wildfires in Maui, Hawaii. In order to provide relief to the affected people, Japan has decided to offer a total of around $2 million of support. I offer my heartfelt prayer for the earliest possible recovery of the affected areas.
May I also once again convey my heartfelt condolences for the passing away of President Yoon's father.
And now I would like to thank Joe for your kind invitation to the two of us to Camp David, a place with history.
President Yoon, I have been meeting you almost on a monthly basis since March of this year. But the fact that we -- the three leaders have got together in this way, I believe, means that we are indeed making a new history as of today.
The international community is at a turning point in history. In order to allow the potential of our trilateral strategic collaboration to bloom and to blossom, I wish to take this moment to raise the security -- the coordination between Japan, ROK, and the U.S. to new heights while strengthening the coordination between the Japan-U.S. and the U.S.-ROK alliances as we deepen our cooperation in the response to North Korea.
I wish to expand and deepen our collaboration in extensive areas, including economic security, such as critical and emergent technology, cooperation, and supply chains resilience.
Today, I look forward to engaging in frank discussions amongst ourselves in order to declare a new area of Japan, U.S., ROK partnership.
I once again express my gratitude for Joe's initiative. Thank you.
PRESIDENT BIDEN: Thank you. We politely ask the press to -- to leave. Thank you for coming in.

"August 17, 2023","Remarks in an Exchange with Reporters in Avoca, Pennsylvania","
THE PRESIDENT: I'm just going to make a brief comment about my friend, Ellen Casey. You know, she -- I don't know if -- some of you Scrantonians may have known her. But she loved with a fierceness and a tenderness that was incredible. And it was the Irish of her. She just was incredible.
And I was saying earlier that -- my sister and I were talking about her. And my sister reminded me of a quote about Michelangelo. It said: He saw the angel in the marble and carved until he set it free. That's what she did with everybody. I mean, she really did, if you're knew her.
I know this sounds like an exaggeration, but I've been coming back home since -- I've never left, actually. And I've known the Caseys for the bulk of my life. I don't remember when I didn't know the Ca- -- the Caseys.
And Bobby's dad was older than me, then I am older than Bobby. And we lived not far from one another. He was on Wyoming Avenue, and I lived on North Washington Avenue. We went to the same parish, St. Paul's.
And anyway, just a -- she's an incredible woman. And she raised an enormously successful and decent family. All the values I learned, I learned them here in Scranton. And she was an embodiment of them.
So, I -- the reason I am not going to the funeral tomorrow is everyone would have to be wanded to go in -- that I'd -- I'd mess everything up if I went.
But in addition to that, I have to meet with -- at Camp David with two world leaders tomorrow morning.
But in addition, I didn't come -- I'm not going to stay at the viewing when the people are coming in. But, again, they have to be wanded; I just become an impediment.
I just want to show my respect to the family. So --
Q: Can you tell us about your Hawaii trip, sir?
THE PRESIDENT: No, not now. I'm going to be leaving, and I'll be there on Monday.
Q: Why is it important that you go?
Q: Sir, do you think --
THE PRESIDENT: Thank you.
",,
"August 17, 2023","Remarks in an Exchange with Reporters at Joint Base Andrews in Prince George's County, Maryland","
THE PRESIDENT: I'll speak about one thing: Mrs. Casey. Nothing else.
Q: Okay.
THE PRESIDENT: Do you have a question about Casey?
Q: Yes. What was her role in -- in your life?
THE PRESIDENT: She played an enormous role, not just in my life but everyone's.
You know, there's a quote my sister always uses about Michelangelo. It says: He saw the angel in the marble, and he carved and he set it free. That's who she was. She was an incredible woman -- decent, honorable. Her values were amazing.
And every time I would go to Scranton over the years, I would stop and see her. She was a friend.
Anyway, I'm going up or I'm going to be late for Bobby.
Q: Will you come talk to us about Hawaii?
Q: On the Camp David summit, are you willing to share what your goals are for the summit, sir?
THE PRESIDENT: Not until I meet with them.
Q: Okay. Thank you.

"August 16, 2023",Remarks on the Anniversary of the Inflation Reduction Act,"
THE PRESIDENT: Thank you, Scott. (Applause.) Thank you, thank you, thank you. (Applause.) Please, thank you.
I think your patience today exceeds your good judgment, but thank you. (Laughter.)
And I want to say one thing to your children: I know some really great ice cream places around here -- (laughter) -- and Daddy owes you. Okay? (Laughter.) So, talk to me afterwards.
Folks, thanks for the introduction. And, Scott, thank you very much.
You know, I want to thank Vice President Harris; members of the Cabinet -- Secretary Vilsack, Administrator Regan; you know, members of Congress, and particularly Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi, who played such a pivotal role in getting this bill done.
Everyone was telling us there is no possibility with the divided Congress -- the way it was -- that we could get it done. And you got it done without a single vote on the other team, although that began to change at the end.
And all the special guests, state and local leaders, business leaders, entrepreneurs, advocates.
You know, one year ago, with your leadership, I signed the Inflation Reduction Act into law and -- one of the most significant laws I think has ever been enacted -- taking on the special interests and winning -- and winning. (Applause.)
Delivering -- delivering on promises that have long been made to the American people to lower costs for families, especially healthcare costs, increase America's energy security, restore fairness to a tax code, create good-paying jobs here in America, and to address the existential threat of climate crisis.
You know, it's part of a much broader vision for our country: growing the economy from the middle out and the bottom up, not the top down.
I'm a capitalist. I think if you can go make a billion dollars, go make it. I'm all for that. Just pay your taxes. (Laughter.)
But because when the middle class does well -- all kidding aside -- everybody does well. Everybody. The poor have a ladder up. The middle class are -- have a good shot. And -- and -- and the wealthy do very well.
The Financial Times and the Wall Street Journal initially called my plan ""Bidenomics."" I'm not sure they meant it in a totally complimentary way at the time. (Laughter.) But guess what? It's working. (Applause.)
Our economic plan -- made possible by all of you in this room, and that's not hyperbole -- created more than 13 million 400 thousand jobs -- new jobs since I took office. Nearly 800 -- (applause) -- nearly 800,000 manufacturing jobs.
Where is it written that America can't create the most vibrant and innovative economy and be the world's leading manufacturer again? Where is that written? I didn't see that anywhere.
We've created more jobs in two years than any administration has in a single four-year term. And I'm very proud -- (applause) -- and I'm very proud that unemployment has been below 4 percent for the longest stretch in over 50 years. (Applause.) Below 4 percent and going down.
We now have more jobs than we did before the pandemic. And workers aren't just finding more jobs, they're finding better jobs, higher pay, higher job satisfaction. And unemployment is down and so is inflation.
Remember what the experts told us, okay? And they're traditional economists, very smart women and men. They told us getting inflation under control, in order to do it, we had to lower wages and increase unemployment. Not a joke. Had to lower wages and increase unemployment.
But we never, never, never thought the problem was too many people -- I -- at least, I didn't -- too many people that were working or that working people were making too much money. I just thought that was not the best answer to how to get it down.
Now, one reason we've seen inflation fall by two thirds without losing jobs is corporate profits are coming back down to earth. The excesses are being eliminated by the corporations.
We have more to do, but inflation is now at the lowest point it's been in two years.
When the Inflation Reduction Act was passed a year ago today, inflation was -- as pointed out by Chuck or Nancy; I can't remember which one -- 8.3 percent. It's now down to 3.2 percent -- (applause) -- the lowest amount -- and it's going to go lower.
But here's the point: It's lowest among the world's leading economies. Take every major economy in the world. We have the lowest uninflat- -- inflation rate.
At the same time, wages are growing faster than inflation, and this matters.
The way I think about inflation is the way my dad used to talk about it around the kitchen table. Not a joke. I'm being deadly earnest about this. He'd ask, ""How much is left after all the monthly bills are paid? How much do you have left over after you pay them all? And is there -- at the end of the month, just to have a little bit of breathing room. Just a little bit of breathing room.""
That's one of the reasons why we've worked so hard dealing with Pharma and other things. Not only do you get the overall cost of average people and the monthly bills down, in addition to inflation, the Inflation Reduction Act is giving people more breathing room, as my dad would say. And it's supercharging the economic transition in key ways.
First, it's taking the most aggressive action ever on climate energy -- ever. I've long said -- and I've -- that's why I think all the unions have come along. I've long said: When I think climate -- not a joke -- I think jobs. I think jobs. (Applause.) For real.
And, by the way, none of this would have happened had the unions not stepped up and supported us. The idea -- (applause) -- they wouldn't have. It would not have happened.
This law is one of the biggest drivers of jobs and economic growth this country has ever seen.
Since I took office, the private sector has announced nearly 400 -- excuse me -- $240 billion in new clean energy manufacturing investments. That's private sector -- $240 billion investment. (Applause.)
And the law has already created an estimated 170,000 clean energy jobs in one year. It's estimated that it will -- it will -- that will grow to 1.5 million more jobs over the next decade. First, it was one year. Now we're talking about the decade.
You know, just don't take it from me. The CEO of U.S. Steel called the Inflation Reduction Act ""Manufacturing…"" -- he called it the ""Manufacturing Renaissance Act"" because it's bringing jobs back to America, manufacturing here in America. Made in America.
According to leading Wall Street firms Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, my broader investment -- our broader investment in Investing in America agenda is unleashing a boom -- a boom of manufacturing investments.
And we're leaving nobody behind. We're investing in all of America: in the Heartland and coast to coast.
You know, I saw some of our -- a few of my Democratic friends -- not in Congress -- but friends said, ""Look, you're -- you're investing more in red states than in blue states."" Well, I made a commitment. This is about all of America. I was the Pre- -- (applause) -- no, I really mean it.
And we've seen progress across the country, from Maine to South Carolina, to Minnesota, to New Mexico. The Vice President and I and the Cabinet have seen progress across the country.
Just yesterday, I was in Wisconsin at a -- at a company that makes clean energy equipment, including wind turbines. Because of the Inflation Reduction Act, they expect their market in American-made wind turbine generators to double next year.
And, by the way, the guy who was the most ardent opponent of all this was talking about what great benefits are coming to Wisconsin. (Laughter.)
Bless me, Father. I have -- (laughter). I'm going to be a good boy. (Laughter.) I'm going to keep the Irish in me down a little bit here. (Laughter.)
At the same time, we're also boosting our nation's energy security. For years, China dominated the clean energy supply chains. We became -- we let the American jobs and factories go overseas. For how long have we gone through this period where the answer for the previous -- mostly in Republican, but some Democratic administrations -- the answer had been: Find the cheapest labor in the world; go -- close the factory here, build it over there, wherever that is; and then import the product from abroad?
Not anymore. We are building it here and sending the product over there. (Applause.) No, I mean it.
We're bringing -- we're bringing critical supply chains and technologies home for electric vehicle batteries, solar panels, wind turbines, critical minerals.
And because of the CHIPS and Science Act, we've generated $231 billion in private investment, in making semiconductors -- $231 billion. A small -- that small computer chip, the size of the end of your -- your fingertip that affects nearly everything in our lives, from cellphones, to automobiles, to the most sophisticated weapons systems.
You know, we invented these chips. We used to produce these chips. We stopped. And we saw it during the pandemic -- we paid a high price for things that went overseas. Factories shut down; we paid a big price. But now we're bringing semiconductors home.
In 2030, the Inflation Reduction Act is projected to help triple wind power and increase solar power by eightfold. By 2030, electric -- electrically deployed -- excuse me, electricity deployed through the U.S. power grid is expected to be powered by 81 percent clean energy. Do you hear me? Eighty-one percent clean energy. (Applause.)
Imagine the impact on climate and the air we breathe. The law is going to help meet all of my bold climate goals by cutting carbon pollution in half by 2030 -- in half by 2030. (Applause.)
And between the Inflation Reduction Act and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, we're investing more than $50 billion to build up resilience in impacts on climate change.
These laws support important priorities, from addressing historic drought along the Colorado River Basin. Remember when I said we had a concern about the Colorado River literally going dry? You all thought I was crazy. I wish I had been. But guess what? I was just out there and looking down on the Grand Canyon. And guess what? It's coming back.
But any rate, we're responding to coastal erosion, sea level rise in the Gulf of Mexico, and helping reduce the effects of extreme heat by investing nearly $1.5 billion to plant trees and expand community parks and forests.
Folks, there's a lot more, and you've heard a lot today, and I'm going to not go into it all. But this law is helping mem- -- families save thousands of dollars on energy bills every year through the tax credit and rebates to buy new and efficient electric appliances, weatherize their homes, install heat pumps, rooftop solar.
As a consequence of this, it's estimated that the consumer is going to save at least $27 billion in electric bills between now and 2030. (Applause.)
We're also offering tax credits up to $7,500 to buy new electric vehicles -- and I've worked it out with the European Union -- (laughter) -- and fuel cells made here in America.
For the first time, we can get a tax credit to buy used electric vehicles. And thanks to the law, new electric vehicles are going to save -- this is -- this is a fact, if we do this -- and we're doing it now -- tens of billions of gallons of gasoline between now and 2030. That's a lot less pollution. (Applause.)
And I'm not even going to start to talk to you about Amtrak. (Laughter.) It's going to save billions of dollars -- and I really mean it -- in energy costs. But we'll get into that later. (Laughter.)
Let me be clear on this point: When I say climate means jobs, I mean good-paying union jobs. (Applause.)
And the law -- and the law will give an added boost to clean energy products that pay a prevailing wage, employ registered apprenticeships, and use made-in-America parts and products, and not violate any international trade agreements. It's all in the law.
And we're rein- -- we're reincentivizing companies to build clean energy projects in the same communities that powered our nation with fossil fuels. We owe them -- whether it was Scranton, Pennsylvania, or West Virginia or wherever it has been. The fos- -- they've -- they've supplied the fossil fuels we needed for generations.
For example, next generation batteries are being made in an old steel mill in West Virginia. Solar panels are going to be -- to go -- going to a closed coal plant in New Mexico.
These incentives are going to help make clean energy jobs good-paying union jobs and ensure the benefits of clean energy economy reaching communities left behind. And they're left behind -- when they left behind, they lost their pride. They lost a sense of who they were. They lost what was going on. To reach communities too often left behind -- and that's the focus.
And we're already seeing it happen. Laborers and carpenters are building solar farms. Iron workers and operating engineers building wind projects. Electricians installing solar panels and electric vehicle chargers. By the way, 500,000 of those suckers. And it's going to mean a lot. And it's a big deal.
The clean energy economy should also be a win-win for auto companies and union workers. You know, as the Big Three automakers and companies -- the United Auto Workers negotiated a new collective bargaining agreement, I'm asking him to work together to forge a fair agreement.
Together -- together, we can make this transition to a clean energy future fair and just. And that means ensuring that auto jobs continue to be good jobs that can su- -- you can support a family on. (Applause.)
But auto companies honor the right of workers to organize, taking every possible step to avoid painful plant closings. And that when transitions are needed, they are fair and designed to retool, reboot, and rehire the same -- in the same factory and communities at a competitive wage while the existing workers get the first shot to fill those jobs. That's only fair. It matters.
Second, because the Inflation Reduction Act, we're -- we're -- we're talking about lifesaving steps to reduce healthcare costs. It locks in place the lower healthcare premiums for millions of American families under the Affordable Care Act, saving them an average of $800 a year.
And I see my friends in the Congress who saw that -- in the Senate and House who saw that -- make that happen.
Plus, we pay more for our prescription drugs than any country -- major country in the world. The cu- -- the product made here in the United States sold in Montreal or Paris or anywhere around the world is cheaper than it's made here, where it was -- where it's been produced.
For years, many of us have been trying to give Medicare the power to negotiate lower drug prices, which would reduce, by the way, the federal deficit at the same time. Because when Medicare doesn't have to pay the high price, guess what? It cuts your taxes. It cuts the amount of money that the federal government has to pay.
For years, Big Pharma won. Big Pharma blocked us. But not this time. (Applause.)
I know I don't look it, but I've been arou- -- I've been around for 400 years. (Laughter.) And I've been fighting Pharma on this since the 1970s. No, not a joke.
This time, we finally beat Big Pharma. Medicare finally has the power to negotiate lower prescription drug prices, like the Department of Veterans Affairs has -- had the power.
That's not all. We've heard -- you've heard -- this was already spoken to: insulin. Companies pay -- it costs -- and, by the way, the guy who invented the insulin, he never patented it because he wanted it available for everybody. It never was patented.
And guess what? It costs 10 bucks to make. And if you use everything including packaging, it could be as high as 12 and a half dollars. Now those companies are charging 30 times that amount.
Now seniors on Medicare -- and, by the way, it should be beyond seniors and Medicare, but I'll come back to that at another time -- were paying as much as $400 a month for insulin. And they're now just paying 35 bucks a month.
We're also capping total out-of-pocket expense for drugs for seniors on Medicare to $2,200 a year -- $2,000 a year for even the expensive cancer drugs that could cost as much as $10-, $12-, $14,000 a year. Combine all the costs of their drugs, by 2025, they'll never have to pay more than a total of $2,000 after 2025. (Applause.)
One -- one in three -- one in three seniors on Medicare is going to save an average of $400 a year. Seniors with the highest drug costs are going to save an average of $2,500 a year. And the Pharma companies are still going to do very, very well.
The laws require that drug companies will raise prices faster than inflation. If they do that, they're going to have to pay the difference back to Medicare. That'll create an incentive to keep prices from skyrocketing. And negotiating drug prices alongside other parts of the law will save the federal government $160 billon -- reducing the cost of government by $160 billion.
It will lower the federal deficit because it means -- what happens here is Medicare is going to be paying less for the prescription drugs they deliver to the American people. So, it not only lowers cost for the -- for the person receiving the drug, it lowers the cost for taxpayers -- lowers the cost for taxpayers.
And it gets to a third win for the American people with this law: We've made all the progress without raising taxes on the middle class.
I made a commitment -- and some thought it was too -- too much of a commitment; it's too high -- that no one making less than $400,000 a year will pay a single penny more in federal taxes. It's a commitment I've kept so far. And as long as I'm president, I will keep it.
Unlike the last president, in my first two years in office, we actually cut the federal debt -- deficit by $1.7 trillion. You hear me? The first two years -- we cut the debt [deficit] by $1.7 trillion. (Applause.)
And through this law, we're going to continue cutting the deficit and cutting subsidies to Big Pharma and ensuring the wealthy and big corporations begin to pay their fair share of federal taxes.
Does anyone here think that the tax system is fair? In 2020 -- you remember, I was a pain in the neck about this; I know -- there were 55 of the largest corporations in America who paid zero in federal taxes -- 55 of the 500 -- of the Fortune 500. And they made $40 billion in profit. Didn't pay a penny.
Not anymore. The law requires a minimum tax of 15 percent on our biggest corporations and a 1 percent excise tax on stock buybacks when they pay profits to shareholders.
The law also saves money by cracking down on super-wealthy tax cheats, making sure billionaires -- who pay -- by the way, there's about a thousand now. We used to have 750 before the pandemic. By the way, if you're going to be a billionaire -- not a problem. I'm -- I'm a capitalist. I also was listed for 36 years the poorest man in the Senate, but that's a different issue. (Laughter.) But billionaires and the biggest corporations should at least pay the taxes they owe.
Do you know what the average tax on a billionaire in America is today -- federal tax? 8.2 percent.
You know, a janitor makes -- pays a higher tax than that.
Folks, this law is transformative. And it feel -- you know, it fell entirely to Democrats to deliver it. I hope we've seen -- with all the people out there claiming the credit for it -- they've decided that we're going to -- they're going to join the fight. They're going to join the fight.
I took a -- I guess I shouldn't get into that. (Laughter.) But one congressperson, who has been particularly strident about me, laid out all that we did. We just took it and used it as an ad. (Laughter and applause.) You think I'm kidding.
Look, the idea that not one single Republican voted for it -- you know, I -- and I know my colleagues know this, and I -- I've had seven of my Repub- -- former Republican colleagues in the Senate come to me and say they agreed with us. And -- but I promised I'd never say their names, and I never will tell anybody. But the reason they did that was -- they said, ""Joe, if I vote for X, Y, or Z, it's going to -- they're going to primary, and it will cost me my election.""
Not a lot of political courage, but an explanation as to why there's a lot of people who believe what we're doing is right, but just -- they're a little worried in this environment.
In fact, Republicans have repeatedly tried to repeal key parts of the Inflation Reduction Act, including the Speaker of the House now -- taking credit for the billions of dollars in private investments and thousands of jobs coming into their states.
That's okay. I ran for president, and I said I would represent all Americans. And like I said at the State of the Union, ""I'll see you at the groundbreaking."" (Laughter.) You think I'm kidding. (Laughter.) You know I'm not.
Let me close with this. I'm not here to declare victory on the economy. Our economy is stronger and better than any industrial nation in the world right now. We -- but we have more work to do. We have a plan that's running -- turning things around. The Inflation Reduction Act is a part of that plan.
Bidenomics is just another way of saying ""restoring the American Dream.""
I believe every American willing to work hard -- and I mean this from the bottom my heart. My dad used to say, ""Joey, a job is about a lot more than a paycheck."" I give you my word. ""A lot more than a paycheck. It's about your dignity. It's about respect. It's about being able to look your kid in the eye and say, 'Honey, it's going to be okay,' and mean it.""
Any re- -- any person willing to work hard should be able to get a job no matter where they live, raise their kids on a good paycheck, and keep their roots where they grew up.
How many of you from Midwestern states and border states have found yourself in a position where -- they provide a good education, and you got a -- the son or daughter comes to you, ""Mom, Dad, I've got to move."" When you were governor of Iowa, how many times did you hear that? You have one of the best education systems in the country. ""But I've got to move, Mom. There's no job for me.""
Bidenomics is anchors -- anchored in what's always worked best for the country: investing in America, investing in Americans. Because when we invest in ourselves, when we strengthen the middle class, we see stronger economic growth. It benefits everybody.
Look, folks, I'm proud of the historic law my administration has passed, but it's not about me, and I mean that from the bottom of my heart. It's about you -- all of you in this room, particularly, but the American people. Folks like the ones standing behind me here today.
The most important thing I want to say today is: Thank you, America. Thank you, Americans.
We've faced some tough times in recent years. But you, the American people, didn't give up. You're the ones getting up every single day going to work. You're the ones taking the risks, opening the doors, hiring workers, fulfilling dreams.
And all we hear from our friends on the other side of the aisle is what they claim is what's wrong with America.
Well, let me tell you -- let -- let me tell you: They're telling us America is failing -- failing? They're dead wrong. They're dead wrong. America isn't failing; America is winning.
And I've said it a thousand times -- (applause) -- I've said it a thousand times -- a thousand times: There is no quit in America.
Name me a single objective we've ever set out to accomplish that we failed on. Name me one in all of our history. Not one.
It's never been a good bet to bet against America, and it's still not a good bet today. This is still a country that believes in honesty, decency, and integrity. We're still a country that believes in hard work.
We're still a country that believes that each and every one of us is created equal. We've never fully lived up to it, but we never walked away from it.
And I guarantee you we're still the beacon for the world. You ought to come with me to all these international meetings. Listen to the rest of the world -- what they say to the President of the United States.
Everyday, ordinary people every day get up and do extraordinary things. That's who we are.
America's best days aren't behind us; they're ahead of us. This isn't about the past. It's about the future we're going to build. And I've never been more optimistic about America's future.
Just remember who in God's name we are. We're the United States of America. And there's nothing, nothing, nothing beyond our capacity when we do it together. (Applause.)
God bless you all. And may God protect our troops.
Thank you, thank you, thank you. (Applause.)

"August 15, 2023","Remarks in Milwaukee, Wisconsin","
THE PRESIDENT: Hello, Milwaukee! Please have a seat if you have one. (Applause.)
Please have a seat if you -- if you have one. (Laughs.) I said that once earlier in my presidency, and there were no chairs. I couldn't see anyth- -- the press wrote, ""Biden doesn't even know whether people can stand or sit."" (Laughter.)
Anyway, it's great to be here.
Thank you, Valentino, for that introduction. And -- and what you said about the union -- you know, I've said it many times: The middle class built America, but unions built the middle class. And that's a fact. (Applause.)
Governor Evers, Mayor Johnson, County Executive Crowley, thank you all for your warm welcome.
And, Tammy Baldwin, you're the best, kid. You're the absolute best. (Laughter.) If I had another 10 of you, we could rule the world. You'd really -- thank you for all you do, Tammy. Appreciate it very much. And, you know, no one does a -- no one does more to create good jobs in this state and make sure tomorrow's products are made in America.
Now a very quiet, laidback congresswoman -- (laughter) -- who, thank God, is on my side -- (laughter) -- thank God -- Gwen Moore. She never stopped fighting for the people of Wisconsin. (Applause.) I love you, Gwen. You're the best.
And you got two -- you got a mayor and a county executive. I used to work for the county. I was -- used to be a county councilman when I was 26 years old. And I tell you what, I ran for the Senate because it's too damn hard being on the county council. (Laughter.) Everybody comes up to you and goes, ""Yeah, county -- county council. Yeah. Um, uh…"" ""You wonder what we do, huh?"" Well, the truth of the matter is: They do a hell of a lot. And your mayor is doing a hell of a job as well. (Applause.)
Look, folks, I apologize, because I try very hard to keep my speeches between 15 and 18 minutes, but I got to talk a little bit about Hawaii.
I've often been on the phone with the governor -- coming up here -- and the senators. And -- and let me say -- address that devasting wildfires, some of which are still burning, in Hawaii.
They've claimed the lives of 99 people so far, and they haven't cleaned things up yet. The deadliest wildfire in more than 100 years. A whole city destroyed. Generations of Native Hawaiian history turned into ruin.
I've spoken with Governor Josh Green multiple times and reassured him the state will have everything it needs from the federal government.
I immediately approved the governor's request for an expedited major disaster declaration. That's a fancy word of saying, ""Whatever you need, you're going to get."" And that will get aid into the hands of people who desperately need it -- who have lost their loved ones; who have lost their homes, their livelihoods; who have been damaged and destroyed.
And think about this: All that area they got to plow up, they can't do it now because they don't know how many bodies are there. They don't know what's left.
Imagine being a mom or dad, wondering where your child is. Imagine being a husband or wife or mother or father. It's really tough stuff.
Almost 500 federal personnel have been deployed to Maui to help communities and survivors get back on their feet.
FEMA search and rescue teams are sifting through the ashes in that five-mile area that you've seen on television that's been burned. It's painstaking work. It takes time. It's nerve racking. Most of the debris can't be removed until it's done.
My wife, Jill, and I are going to travel to Hawaii as soon as we can. That's what I've been talking with the governor about. I don't want to get in the way -- I've been to too many disaster areas -- but I want to go and make sure we got everything they need. I want to be sure we don't disrupt the ongoing recovery efforts.
FEMA Administrator Griswell [Criswell] -- who's the best we ever had, I think -- was on the ground this weekend. I just talked to her. She's back in the States. I have directed her to streamline the process as quickly as possible to help register survivors for immediate federal assistance without delay.
To date, FEMA has approved [provided] five tho- -- 50,000 meals; seventy-five liters -- thousand liters of water; 500 [5,000] beds; 10,000 blankets; and -- as well as other shelter supplies for survivors displaced in -- from their homes.
FEMA also authorized one-time payments of $700 per household to folks who have been displaced so they can do the immediate things of just taking care of medications and prescriptions that they so badly need.
We're working with the state to make sure survivors that have lost their homes have a place to call home until we can rebuild.
We're also surging federal personnel to the state to help the brave firefighters and first responders, many of whom lost their own homes, their properties while they're out busting their neck to save other people. How many have so -- been so impacted themselves? But they're still working around the clock to put the fires out, evacuate survivors to safety, and find the missing.
I have ordered all available federal assets on the island to assist local crews, including the U.S. Coast Guard, the Navy Third Fleet, and the U.S. Army.
In the immediate aftermath, the Coast Guard and Navy supported maritime searches and rescue operations. The Army helicopters helped fire suppression and efforts on the Big Island -- because there's still some burning on the Big Island, not the one that is -- not the one where you -- you see on television all the time. FEMA has deployed more than 140 Urban Search and Rescue personnel as well.
And there are so many organizations to thank, like the American Red Cross, helping survivors missing loved ones. Cellphone providers are making sure first responders can make and respond to emergency calls. Commercial airlines that have evacuated tens of thousands of people from the island.
The list goes on.
And the Small Business Administration has dozens of staff on the island and has begun making low-interest federal disaster loans available to Hawaii -- Hawaii businesses, homeowners and renters, and non-profits to help them begin to rebuild -- just to get by for the immediate near term.
And we're going to coordinate and continue to coordinate relentlessly with the people on the ground to make sure the critical work continues.
In the meantime -- you always hear this phrase; and I've been to so many disasters in my career, it's almost hollow -- our prayers -- our thoughts and prayers are with the people of Hawaii. But not just our prayers. Every asset -- every asset they need will be there for them. And we be -- we'll be there in Maui as long as it takes. As long as it takes. And I meant that sincerely.
We're going to have more to report on this.
But today, I come to Milwaukee to talk about what we're doing to bring manufacturing back home. It's about our progress building an economy from the middle out and the bottom up, not the top down. You know, when we -- it's that trickle-down economics. Not a hell of a lot landed on my dad's kitchen table. But when the middle works and the bottom has a shot up, the wealthy do very well.
I'm a capitalist. If you can make a billion dollars, go make it. I mean it. Just pay a little more taxes than you're paying right not. Eight percent doesn't quite get it. (Applause.)
But, look, I came to office determined to move away from the trickle-down economics and to focus on the middle class. Because I said when the middle class does well, everybody does well -- everybody does well.
The Financial Times and the Wall Street Journal started calling my plan -- not initially as a compliment -- ""Bidenomics.""
But guess what, folks? They're talking about it differently now. It's working. It's working -- (applause) --
I'm serious -- because we're investing in America.
According to Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, my plan is leading to a boom -- they called it a boom -- in manufacturing and manufacturing investment, as you've seen right here in this factory: over 13.4 million new jobs, 150,000 new jobs in the state of Wisconsin. (Applause.) Nearly 800,000 new manufacturing jobs nationwide. More than 20,000 manufacturing jobs in Wisconsin, from Green Bay to Verona to Pleasant Prairie. (Applause.)
We've added more jobs in two years than any president has in American history in a four-year term. More in two than any has done in four. (Applause.)
And unemployment has been below 4 percent for the longest stretch in over 50 years -- 50 years.
Wisconsin's unemployment rate is just 2.5 percent. That's lower than it was every single month the prior administration. (Applause.)
We've recovered all the jobs lost during the pandemic, and we've added millions more. People are coming off the sidelines and getting back into the workplace.
Remember, a while there, they were saying, ""Well, Biden is just allowing people not to work and get paid."" Guess what? A higher percentage of American workers are working today than ever before. (Applause.)
And while unemployment is down, in case you haven't noticed, inflation is down, too, and it's going lower. (Applause.)
Rememeber -- remember what the experts said? To get inflation under control, you needed lower wages and higher unemployment. Not a joke. Those of you who are economists know that's the economic mantra: To get inflation under control, fewer jobs, more unemployment. That's number one. And making sure that you don't have to deal with -- that's what they say caused the inflation.
But I never thought the problem was too many people working or working people making too much money. And one reason we've seen inflation fall by two thirds without losing jobs is that we're seeing corporate profits come back to -- down to earth.
You know, we've done more -- we've done -- we have more to do with inflation, though. It's just about 3 percent now, and it's predicted to go lower than that. We're near the lowest point in over 2 years.
And at the same time, the pay for low-wage workers has grown at the fastest rate in two decades. Wages are growing faster than inflation.
Folks, that's Bidenomics. It's about growing an economy by strengthening the middle class -- (applause) -- and making things in America again.
You know, it's in stark contrast to the conservative Republican view -- the so-called MAGA view -- which is focused on corporate profits. They say we should find that -- the rationale up to now has been: Let's find the cheapest place in the world to make our product. Let's shut down the corpo- -- the -- the operation in America and send it overseas, and then send the refined product back to America and sell it here.
That's their philosophy. But you know who believes that? Your significant senator, Ron Johnson.
He believes outsourcing manufacturing jobs is a great thing. He's on record as saying he doesn't agree with American work- -- this is what he said: American workers should manufacture -- he doesn't think they should manufacture products that require a lot of labor. Here's what he said, quote, ""Let the billions of people around the world do that."" End of quote.
You wonder why the hell we got ourselves in trouble. (Laughter.)
Well, we've been letting them do that for too damn long. It's time to build American products in America. (Applause.)
You can see how Ron Johnson's rationale and the MAGA rationale worked out. Between the year 2000 and January 2021, Wisconsin alone lost more than 136,000 manufacturing jobs alone.
I'd like to see Senator Johnson talk about those -- to talk to those 136,000 people and tell them it doesn't matter whether you manufacture things at home or overseas.
It sure as hell does, man. (Applause.) Not only for those 136,000 people who lost their jobs, but for their families and the communities and the economic growth it generated here at home.
Let's take a look at how the Johnson philosophy played out -- the real time in Wisconsin, like in Kenosha, about 40 miles from here. There used to be a lot of people assembling automobiles there, making a direct [decent] living for their families, generating economic growth for Kenosha, until the American Motors plant closed in '88.
Or take a look at Milwaukee, known as the manufacturing powerhouse for so long. That's -- when I got to the Senate, I -- I've been around about 200 years. (Laughter.) When I got to the Senate in 1973, Milwaukee was a manufacturing powerhouse. That's how it was referred to. Not a joke. Not a joke.
I don't have to tell anyone in this audience how hard people here work and all of you -- all you -- all you've done to keep this city strong.
Still, by early 2000, Milwaukee had lost around two out of three factory jobs. Eighty thousand jobs were gone. Eighty thousand. And when those jobs were lost, something else was lost as well: pride, a sense of dignity.
My dad -- and I swear to God this was the expression -- used to have an expression. My dad was a high school-educated guy, was well-read, and worked like hell. He didn't have a chance to go to college. He used to say, ""Joey…"" -- and this is the God's truth -- ""Joey, a job is about a lot more than a paycheck. It's about dignity. It's about respect. It's about being able to look your child in the eye and say, 'Honey, it's going to be okay,' and mean it."" That's what a job is about. That's what a job is about. (Applause.)
And when the breadwinner in the family loses their job, they lose their pride and the sense of dignity that goes with that.
And people like Ron believe that is a good thing -- that corporate American bottom line is that that's all you need to look at; it's good for America.
Well, that's not my bottom line.
From the day I took office, I was determined to turn it around with -- with now they're calling ""Bidenomics."" It's one of the reasons why I fought so hard to write and get passed the CHIPS and Science Act. (Applause.)
We used to invest more in science and research than any country in the world: almost 2 percent of our gross domestic product. Now it's about seven tenths of 1 percent we invest.
We're the best engineers in the world. We're the best scientists in the world. We're the best researchers in the world. What the hell are we doing?
Well, guess what? That CHIPS and Science Act has generated $231 billion in the last 18 months in private investments, making semiconductors here in America. (Applause.)
And, by the way, we -- the United States -- invented those semiconductors. We invented them when we went to the Moon.
They're those small computer chips, the size of the tip of your finger, affecting nearly everything in our lives, from cellphones to automobiles to the most sophisticated weapons systems in the world.
Let me give you one concrete example.
I met with the chairman of the largest chipmaker in the world in South Korea -- it's called SK -- when I was in South Korea. They're investing, now, $22 billion -- billion -- in America. And I asked them why. This is the God's truth. ""Why America?""
And he said, ""Number one…"" -- think of this now. Remember it. ""Number one, there's no safer place in the world to have my investment than the United States of America. And number two, you have the best workers in the world."" And he's right. (Applause.) That's the -- that's the truth. (Applause.)
It's about time Ron Johnson and his friends understood that.
Look, folks, they think you want to IBEW -- I wouldn't be standing here this time without you guys. But the IBEW, they think -- the average American, they're not being mean or anything, they think, ""Well, to be an electrician, you say, 'I want to be an electrician,' and you get a -- you get a card.""
Four to five years of apprenticeship. You hear me? Like going back to college. Four to five years. You get paid, but not nearly what you get paid when you get your card.
You got to talk more about what you do and what it takes to get it done. People aren't trying to be mean. They just don't know. But I'm sure in hell telling them. (Laughter and applause.)
The bottom line is: We invented chips here in America. We used to produce them here. We used to produce 40 percent. And now we're bringing them back home, thankfully. (Applause.)
Thankfully, we have people like Tammy Baldwin, who championed -- (applause) -- no, it's the God's truth -- ""Buy American"" policies, leading a resurgence in manufacturing in Wisconsin and across the country.
You heard me say it before: Where in God's name is it written that America can't lead the world again in manufacturing? Where is that written? Folks --
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Nowhere!
THE PRESIDENT: Nowhere. You got it.
Since I took office, we've attracted more than one half trillion dollars -- let me say it again -- one half trillion dollars in private investment in American manufacturing and the industries of the future.
Spending on construction of manufacfur- -- to manufacturing plants that need to be built nearly doubled in the last two years.
And, you know, that's not just -- that's not just the permanent jobs -- they're generating growth -- economic growth and buil- -- look, construction jobs do that as well. We've added 600,000 good-paying construction jobs since I took office.
When they build these -- these plants to build these chips, guess what? They call them ""fabs."" They're as big as football -- long as football fields. That's how big they are. They're gigantic. And guess what? The people who work there -- you know what the average salary is in these fabs? $116,000 a year. Adfsend you don't need a college degree.
What the hell are we talking about? (Applause.)
Folks, instead of exporting American jobs, we're creating American jobs and exporting American products. And they're being built right here in Wisconsin and places where factories had been shut down.
Look at what you're doing here. Ingeteam came to Milwaukee 10 years ago, thanks to tax incentives in clean energy during the Obama-Biden administration.
Then, exactly one year ago tomorrow, I signed a significant piece of clean energy legisla- -- combining -- combatting the existential threat of climate change -- the single largest investment ever, anywhere in the world, without one single member of the other team voting for it. That law reauthorized those clean energy tax credits and expanded them.
As a result, this com- -- this company -- this company predicts that demand for the wind turbine generators, which they're making right here in this facility, will double next year. (Applause.)
And since I took office, the private sector has announced more than $3 billion in investments -- not million, billion -- in investments for wind energy manufacturing in America. And, by the way, it's cheaper -- cheaper -- cheaper than fossil fuels. (Applause.) Cheaper than fossil fuels.
And that's not all.
Until this year, this company didn't think it made sense to make chargers for electric vehicles in the United States. But then, when I signed the Bipartisan Infra- -- Law -- again, which -- which Ron Johnson and his friends didn't vote -- they all voted against -- that law invests $7.5 billion to build a network of thousands of electric vehicle chargers stretching across the country, including on I-94.
By the way, over 500,000 of these charging stations. That's real jobs. That's real money.
And, by the way, my Grandpop Biden, who died very young -- he was -- died in the hospital I was born in six days before I was there -- I mean before I was born -- he worked for the American Oil Company. His job was to go from town to town, expanding the American Oil Company, building new gas stations. People didn't know whether they wanted a couple thousand gallons of gasoline under the ground where they are.
What happens when you build a gas station? You end up with something like a 7/11 or a doughnut shop or a drugstore around it. It generates economic growth. We're going to be building these facilities all across America so you can plug in and go the width of the country. That way you can travel coast to coast without worrying about running out of power.
Every single one of these chargers must be installed by workers certified by the IBEW plan. Every one. That was a condition. (Applause.) Every one. And every single one must be made in America. (Applause.)
You know, there's a provision in the law that -- I thought I knew a fair amount. But I didn't realize -- maybe you did, Tammy, but I didn't realize, back in the '30s, they passed a law that's consistent with international trade that if the Congress passes a law to spend money and the President has to decide where to spend it, he has to -- he or she has to spend it on American workers and in -- in America -- American products.
Well, most presidents, including Democrats, didn't pay a lot of attention to that. But I did. (Laughter and applause.)
And so, now, to use a non-American product, you've got to have a real good reason, prove to me you can't in fact get it from an American product.
Look, folks, this company concluded that it was an opportunity for them as well. And now, they're making fast-charging EV chargers here in America, right in Wisconsin. (Applause.)
Their goal is to manufacture 13,000 high-speed chargers every single year. And guess what? To the chagrin of your senator -- the other senator -- it's going to add 100 good-paying jobs. (Applause.)
And, folks, this is happening across the state. It's a direct result of those clean energy investments I signed into law a year ago.
Folks, as I've said for a long time -- for a long time: When I think climate, I think jobs. Not a joke. When I think climate, I think jobs. That's the future.
By the way, Texas -- the state of Texas has a very enlightened governor. The very state of Texas has the signifi- -- highest number of wind and solar facilities, I think, of any state in the nation. And it's cheaper than -- than fossil fuel. He wants to shut them down. Isn't that enlightened?
Like the 12 solar energy products in -- Alliant Energy is building across Wisconsin, creating more than 2,000 jobs -- local construction jobs -- most of them union jobs -- and, in the process of serving customers in Wisconsin, saving them more than $1.6 billion in energy costs. These are facts, not fiction.
And back to Kenosha, which was hit hard by the American Motors when it closed, now Paris Solar has broken down in the state -- broke ground on the state's first large-scale solar and battery storage project in Kenosha County. It's creating 300 good-paying construction jobs. Three hundred. (Applause.)
And just today, the company Siemens announced that because of that law I signed and the significant investments we're making in clean energy, they're going to begin manufacturing solar inverters here in Wisconsin. (Applause.)
And, by the way, the American people are going to be learning -- no matter how well educated, you're going to be learning a lot, because I bet most people don't know what a solar inverter is. It converts solar energy from the sun into electricity. Kind of a novel idea, isn't it?
How many times did you ever think, in those days when you had those real big bills in the winter and a hot day came, ""Well, why couldn't we capture all this?"" Well, guess what? They're going to be doing a piece of that. Sunlight shines down, and the inverter turns it into electricity. And they're going to build them just outside of Kenosha.
Don't tell me Americans can't innovate. Don't tell me that.
Since I took office, I've seen more than $3 billion in private investment in clean energy manufacturing, all across Wisconsin. That's Bidenomics. That's investing in America. (Applause.)
Totally consistent with international law and trade agreements.
And investing in America means investing in all of America.
When I ran for president, I made a promise that I would leave no one behind, no part of the country would I leave behind.
I'm getting mad -- a lot of Democrats are getting mad at me because we're investing actually more in red states than blue states right now. But they're all Americans, and I made a promise. I made a promise: no matter where.
And folks, red states, blue states, urban, suburban, or rural -- all of that will benefit from what we do.
That's why I launched the Rural Partners Network to help rural communities, including here in Wisconsin and my state of Delaware -- which is mostly rural, believe it or not -- create jobs and economic opportunity.
And my administration has invested hundreds of millions of dollars to support small- and medium-sized meat and poultry processors across the Midwest, including dozens here in Wisconsin, from Lancaster to Richland Center to Soldiers Grove.
This way, farmers can get the best price for their product. They don't have to deal with the only giant processor that pays them less for what they need -- what they're do- -- (applause) -- no, I mean it.
And that wasn't my idea. That was the Secretary of Agriculture, the former governor of Iowa.
But, folks, that's not all. We're also investing $230 million in Wisconsin to support agriculture that's good for the environment, like planting cover crops that replenish the soil with nutrients and absorb carbon from the air. We're helping farmers, ranchers, foresters get paid for doing the right thing.
It's simple, folks: When farmers do well, when the wealth they generate stays in Wisconsin, then their children can stay in Wisconsin and find opportunity here and build a stronger rural economy. (Applause.)
Investing in America also means rebuilding our infrastructure. The governor talked about how many bridges and roads -- I mean, it's amazing. And it's not even been a year yet. It's just been about a year.
You know, the last guy who talked about ""Infrastructure Month""? We got ""Infrastructure Decade,"" baby. (Applause.) Ten years. Y'all think I'm kidding. They never had one month.
But I'm jo- -- I'm not joking.
And, by the way, a number of my Republican friends voted against this infrastructure bill, including your distinguished other senator.
You know, we used to be number one in the world in infrastructure, but, over time, we slipped to the 13th best infrastructure. Thirteenth best infrastructure in the world from number one.
How can you be the best economy in the world with a second-rate infrastructure? Not a joke. How can you do that?
Well, through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, we've already announced 37,000 projects, 4,500 communities across America, including hundreds of projects, as the governor referenced, right here in Wisconsin. (Applause.)
Let me give you a couple of examples.
We're investing $80 million to replace the interstate bridge over the Wisconsin River in Columbia County. That's a major route connecting people to Milwaukee, Madison, and Chicago.
And look across town, where union workers are building North Holton Street Bridge, which is nearly 100 years old. More than 10,000 vehicles travel over it every single day across the Milwaukee River. It's dangerous, and this reconstruction is long overdue. (Applause.)
You were -- a lot of you were with me when I was in Pittsburgh. And, by the way, the -- Pittsburgh is ""the city of bridges."" More bridges in Pittsburgh than any other city in America. I watched that bridge collapse. I got there and saw it collapse with over 200 feet off the ground, going over a valley. And it collapsed.
Thank God school was out during the -- during the pandemic. Imagine all the people who would've died. They knew for years they had to do something, but we're talking hundreds of millions of dollars to rebuild it.
You know, I know everybody kids me because I'm an Amtrak guy. I like rail. (Applause.) Well, I've traveled over 1,280,000 miles on Amtrak. And I know you think that's nuts. I do, too, but my -- (laughter) -- and the reason for that is: When I got elected, I was 29 years old. I was in an office hiring staff, and I got a phone call saying my wife and daughter were dead and my two boys were not likely to live. A tractor trailer broadsided and killed them.
And I didn't want to stay in Washington. So, I said they -- a lot of really good senators, including a couple good Republican friends -- became friends -- said, ""Just come and stay six months; help us organize."" Hell, we had -- we had 58 Democratic senators already and a Democratic governor. I didn't know any better.
But I stayed. And I started to commute every day, because having been listed as the poorest man in the Congress for 36 years -- true. My wife called me one day and said, ""Did you read the paper today?"" And I was up campaigning for a guy named Pat Leahy in Vermont. I said, ""No, honey. I didn't see the Wilmington paper."" She said, ""Headline, above the fold…"" -- only a politician's wife would say that -- (laughter) -- ""'Biden, poorest man in Congress.' Is that true?"" Like I was cheating on her or something. (Laughter.)
But I was. And I couldn't afford a house in Washington, and I couldn't afford a house in Delaware. If I sold my house in Delaware, I would lose the election. So, I started to commute. It's only 300 miles a day, but it still takes me an average of four hours, beginning to end.
And so, what happened was I -- when -- when you travel as Vice President on Air Force planes, they keep a precise number of miles you travel. And I guess it was in my seventh year or sixth year as vice president, I -- there was a headline in a New York paper saying, ""Biden travels almost 1,200,000 miles on -- on Air Force planes."" One -- one million two -- one hundred, or whatever.
I'm getting on the train one day with the -- the Secret Service are the best in the world. They don't like me traveling on the train because there are too many opportunities for people to do bad things on trains. And so, I'm getting on a train to go home and see my mom, who was sick and in hospice in my home.
And this guy -- I won't mention his name, because they -- it would get him in trouble. But one of the senior guys in Amtrak who I rode -- rode with all the time comes up and goes, ""Joey, baby,"" and grabs my cheek. (Laughter.) I swear to God, I thought they were going to shoot him. (Laughter.)
And I said, ""No, no, no, no."" I said, ""What's the matter, Ang?"" He said, ""We just -- I read this thing about a mil- -- over a million miles on Air Force planes."" He said, ""Hell, you know how many miles you traveled on Amtrak?"" I said, ""No, Ang. I don't know."" He said, ""We just had a retirement dinner up in Newark."" He said, ""You traveled a hundred -- an average 117 days a year, round trip, 300 miles a day, 36 years. That's 1,285,000 miles. I don't want to hear any more about the Air Force."" (Laughter and applause.)
True story, I swear to God.
I'm getting off point here, but anyway. (Laughter.)
But rail saves a lot -- electric rail saves a lot of energy -- a lot of energy and the environment.
Thanks to the infrastructure law, we're providing $23 million to upgrade and modernize Mitchell International Airport, which is going to increase economic activity in Milwaukee. (Applause.)
We're also removing every single lead pipe in Wisconsin -- (applause) -- every single one. These lead pipes are dangerous.
Some of you may remember, I had a guest at the last State of the Union when I was speaking, and it was a young woman named Deanna Branch. She's a Milwaukee mom. She had her 3-year-old son, Aidan, with her, who was hospital- -- twice for lead poisoning because of lead pipes in their home.
Well, guess what? We're removing every single lead pipe in Wisconsin out of the ground. (Applause.) That's a fact. They're a risk to everyone's health, especially to our children's.
And then, over 250,000 homes and small businesses across Wisconsin don't have access to high-speed, affordable Internet. No parent should have to sit outside a McDonald's when we have a -- schools are closed to be able to get on McDonald's Internet so the kid can do their homework. Not a joke. Well, guess what? They do if you don't have Internet at home.
That's why we're investing over $1 billion in every corner of this state, especially rural communities and family farms, with affordable high-speed Internet. Every single home. (Applause.) And folks, all our high-speed Internet projects must use products and construction materials made in America. (Applause.)
Look, folks, it's really kind of basic. We just decided to invest in America again. That's what it's all about.
I want you to see exactly what we're making these investments across the country. If you want to know exactly where they are, you can go on the Internet. Go to: Invest.gov. Put in your location and find out what's happening -- exactly what's happening or scheduled to happen.
Folks, we've done all this without raising anybody's taxes making under 400,000 bucks. (Applause.)
My friends talk about the ""Big Spendin' Biden."" Well, guess what? I made a promise: I'll never raise federal tax on anyone making less than $400,000 a year. I kept my promise. (Applause.)
And unlike the last President, in my first two years in office, even with all we've done, I'm the first one to cut the federal debt [deficit] by $1 trillion 700 billion. (Applause.) One trillion seven hundred billion dollars cut because we generated the growth.
Folks, every Republican voted against our clean energy investment, known as the Inflation Reduction Act. The vast majority voted against the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. But that didn't stop them from claiming credit for protecting the health of their constituents that are getting rid of lead by -- getting rid of lead pipes or putting to work and building new roads and bridges.
Look, I think the vast majority of my Republican colleagues in the Senate know better. We got to stop the partisanship. We've got to stop this stuff.
This legislation they opposed or attack is now the greatest thing to come to their states. You know, there are -- you have Marjorie Taylor Greene -- you know, the very quiet lady from North Caro- -- from -- from Georgia. Well, she's talked about, ""What Biden is doing is what Roosevelt did and what Kennedy did and what…"" -- I thought, ""Well, yeah."" (Laughter.)
But, look, folks, like I said: I made a commitment, because I knew this was going to happen. I knew what would happen is the folks who voted against these things -- and we barely passed them, sometimes by one or two votes -- when it came to their states, would claim credit.
I want them to get credit. That's okay. It's okay, as long as they continue to support the things we're doing.
You know, I re- -- I said I represent all the American people in red states and blue states, but that doesn't mean I can't make fun of the hypocrisy -- (laughter) -- of those claiming credit. And like I said in the State of the Union, I'll see them at the groundbreakings. (Laughs.) (Applause.)
Look, let me close with this. I'm not here to declare victory on the economy. We're not there yet. We have more work to do, but we've always had a plan that turning things around, making in -- America stronger and safer and more competitive.
Bidenomics is just another way of saying ""restoring the American Dream."" That's the ba- -- that's what it is, just restoring the American Dream.
I believe every American willing to work hard should be able to get a job no matter where they live -- in the heartland, small towns; raise their kids on a good paycheck; and keep their roots where they grew up.
That's the American Dream. That's Bidenomics.
It's rooted in what has always worked best for this country: investing in America, investing in Americans. Because when we invest in our people, when we strengthen the middle class, we see stronger economic growth that benefits all Americans.
The most important thing I want to say today is this: Thank you. Not thank you for how you voted, but thank you to the people of Wisconsin. Thank you to the American people.
We've faced some pretty tough times in recent years. The pandemic took over 1 million lives. How many empty chairs are there sitting around dining room tables these days? Our neighbors, our friends, our fellow Americans -- they're still living in pain and loss and isolation caused by the pandemic.
It generated the most severe economic crisis since the Great Depression. It wasn't that long ago that 20 million people in America were out of work.
But today, the American people -- they didn't give up. Wisconsin didn't give up. Americans didn't give up. America didn't give up.
And I've said it a thousand times: There is no quit in America. There is no quit in America. Look how far we've come. (Applause.)
Today -- today -- it's not hyperbole -- we have the strongest economy in the world. And you're looking at me a little skeptical, but I promise you. Check it out. The strongest economy in the world, the highest job satisfaction in 36 years.
Our inflation rate has dropped to the lowest among major economy -- economic nations in the world. And if we keep it up, it's going to go lower, according to (inaudible).
All I hear from my friends on the other side of the aisle is what is wrong with America. There's a lot wrong with America, like every country. They tell us America is failing, but they're wrong.
Democrats, Republicans, independents, conservatives, liberals -- I don't think they understand the average American. Whatever (inaudible) we set our mind to as a country, we've always accomplished. Name me one thing in American history where America stood together and said, ""We're going to solve that problem"" and we didn't do it. Name me one. Name me one.
There's nothing beyond our capacity.
America isn't failing. America is winning. (Applause.)
And I'm proud of the historic legislation my administration has passed. They were the right steps not only to get our economy moving again but to build to the future.
But the real hero in this story is all of you, and I mean this from the bottom of my heart: the people of Milwaukee, the people of Wisconsin, the American people.
Yes, my policy helped create a lot of these jobs and it has continued to grow, but you're the ones getting up every single day, walking out that door, and doing the work.
Yes, my policies have helped to create some small businesses. We've created more than in any time in history. But you're the ones who decided to borrow the money and take the risk in the middle of this (inaudible). You took the risk to hire workers, fulfilling your dreams.
I've long said it's never, ever, ever been a good bet to bet against America -- never, never, never. And it's not a good bet today.
This is still a country that believes in honesty, decency, and integrity. The vast majority of Americans do. Our political leaders sometimes in both parties don't.
We're still a country that believes in hard work. We're still a country that believes in -- each and every one of us is created equal. We're still a beacon to the world.
That's because small towns and in rural America and suburbs, big cities all across the country, every ordinary perpso-- -- people -- all ordinary people do the most extraordinary things.
Let me tell you, America's best days are ahead, not behind us. Not because of me. Because of you.
It isn't about the past; it's about the future. It's about each of us writing the next chapter in American history.
I can honestly say I've never been more optimistic -- and I mean this from the bottom of my heart -- I've never been more optimistic about America's future, both domestic and foreign.
We just have to remember who in the hell we are. We're the United States of America. There is nothing -- nothing -- beyond our capacity when we do it together.
So, let's do it together, God love ya. (Applause.)
May God bless you all. And may God protect our troops.
Thank you. (Applause.)

"August 10, 2023","Remarks at a Campaign Reception in Park City, Utah","
Please, please sit down. Thank you. Well, first of all, you know, I had forgotten about that incident. It was the time when there was a lot of discussion going on in the administration: Would we recognize same-sex marriage?
And I was raised—I was a lucky man. I was raised by a father who was a—thought everyone was entitled to be treated with dignity. I remember when I was—I hadn't thought about this a long time. I remember when I was a kid, I was a lifeguard at a country club, but I wanted to—I was—got deeply involved in the civil rights movement. And so I wanted to work in what they called ""The Bucket,"" which was a public housing complex—a large complex on the east side of Wilmington—and—which was all African American.
And they had the—like all big cities, they had three major swimming pools. One on the east side, which is where they—a thousand African American kids a day would come and swim in this big pool. And I wanted to be a lifeguard there.
And so my dad, on the way to work, would drop me off at the city hall to go in and get my application for being the employee—the only White lifeguard that—well, not at the time, but I was the only—I wasn't applying to be the only White—I just happened to be the only White lifeguard.
And it's in what they call Rodney Square. If any of you have any little corporations in Delaware—there's more corporations in Delaware than every other State in America combined, not a joke. And the fact is that it was a great corporate entity at the time: Rodney Square. There was the DuPont Building, the Hercules Building, and other major buildings around that square.
So I was getting out of the car to go into the city hall. And these two well-dressed men leaned over and kissed one another. And I'd never seen that before. I turned and looked at my dad. And I just looked at him. He said: ""Joey, it's simple. They love each other. It's simple."" And so I got lucky, the kind of dad I had.
And these two little kids, when we walked into this home were—when I was talking to them, they said, ""I want you to meet my daddy and my mommy,"" and they were two men. And I watched how they loved both those kids and how the kids loved them.
And I told Barack, at the time, that I wasn't going to go out and make it a campaign issue beforehand. But if anybody asked me, I wasn't going to be silent. No one had asked me. [Laughter] No one ever doubts I mean what I say—I mean when I say; sometimes I say all that I mean.
And so I got on the show, and the first question he asked me was that question. I was persona non grata with everyone but Barack for a while because it was thought to be a political liability.
But look, folks, you know, I think—this is going sound counterintuitive—I've never been more optimistic about America's prospects—not because I'm President. I mean that sincerely. I think we're at a genuine inflection point in world history. It happens every—anywhere from 6 to 10 generations. And things change so rapidly that it's not because of any one man or woman, but there's—like it's watching pieces on the chessboard switch around.
Think of all the change that's going to take place just because of the change in populations, the change in—just global warming, what it's affecting.
And so I am—what makes us best prepared to deal with this, in my view, has been the fact that we're the most unique nation in the history of the world. Now, that sounds like hyperbole—like ""We, the United States""—every other nation is based on ethnicity, religion—something that is coherent. We're the only nation in the world based on an idea—not a joke. An idea: ""We hold these truths to be self-evident that all men and women are created equal endowed by their Creator.""
We've never lived up to it, but we've never walked away from it. That was the idea. And it created the institutions. We're a product of our political institutions. That's what has held us together.
And quite frankly, I know I don't look it, but I've been around a long time. [Laughter]
But all kidding aside, I think—I made a speech when I ran the first time for President in 2020, this last time, at Independence Hall in Philadelphia on democracy. I think democracy is at stake. I think our institutions are being questioned like they've never been before.
You have a President who says if he's reelected, he's going to change the institutional structure of this country. He's made statements, and he means some of it.
And so there's a great deal at stake. But the very thing that many people think is our weakness—is our diversity—I think it's our strength. I think it's our strength.
And I think when—to make a generic, overarching point, whenever—there's never been a problem that the United States has set out to deal with we haven't solved when we've done it together. I'm serious.
I was asked not long ago: If you could do anything, what would you do?"" I said, ""I'd cure cancer."" They said, ""Why?"" Because Americans don't believe we can do that anymore. It seems to be the thing that most people think that is the hardest thing to deal with, and they doubt it. I don't. I don't.
And many of you are doctors and clinicians. And you know we're a step away, across the board. That's why I was able to get $6 billion for our cancer research institute, focusing.
My generic point is this: I've never been a big fan of trickle-down economics. No, I'm serious. And it's been a Democratic and Republican basis for—[inaudible]—for a long, long time.
Not much trickled—my dad was a well-read—he got accepted when he was out of school to Johns Hopkins. Couldn't afford to go and ended up in—anyway, make a long story short—but he was a very well-read man. But my dad—my dad never got to go to school. And he always—it was one of his great regrets he didn't get to go to college.
And my dad used to say: ""Joey, a job is about a lot more than a paycheck. It's about your dignity. It's about respect. It's about being able to look your kid straight in the eye and say, 'It's going to be okay,' and mean it."" And he meant it. That's not hyperbole. My word as a Biden. That was part of the mantra that we learned.
And so I've thought I started off with the notion that, from an economic standpoint, we have enormous opportunities. But the best way to make sure that we're able to live in places like this—and I'm not being solicitous, and I mean it seriously—for the wealthy to do very well—is if the middle class does well, the poor have a way up, and the wealthy do well.
And so one of the things I did, setting out in our economic policy, is to focus on: How do you build a middle class? What do you do to build a middle class? And if you notice, there's no—there's been no—I don't know—hyperbole about the wealthy and all. That's not who I am.
But I am supportive of the notion that middle class people have a shot. And what's the best way to give them a shot? It's provide them access to a decent education.
For example, I met with the Business Roundtable. Many of you know it. Maybe some of you are members. And they asked why I keep talking about spending more money on education.
And I said, ""Well, one of the reasons I do that is because, if you remember, when I was Vice President, I met with 558—excuse me—358 of the Fortune 500 leaders. I said, 'What's the thing you need most, you think? What's the thing you need the most?' He said, 'That you all set a better educated workforce.' I said, 'You used to pay for it.'""
The DuPont Company used to be the eighth largest company in the world when I was—got elected as a 29-year-old kid. They bought a new enterprise; they trained their personnel in that new enterprise. We don't do that anymore. We expect the Government to do it, but the Government doesn't expend the dollars to do that.
We learned, for example, if you are able to—all the studies that were done in the last 12 years from—there was a joint study—Stanford and Harvard—what would happen—you—and all of you know these numbers I know.
But, for example, if you come from a home where it's a broken home, where parents don't read to their children, where there's not books in the house, or where one of the parents is an addict or—the kid coming out of that home is going to hear a million fewer words spoken by the time they get to first grade. Not different words—words. They're not engaged in the conversations. They're going to find themselves in position where they're behind the eight ball.
But if you send a kid to school—reading, writing, and arithmetic—at age 3, you improve by 58 percent the prospect of them going all the way through 12 years of school without a problem and getting on and going to community college.
And why are we not doing that? We can afford to do it. I would argue we can't afford not to do it.
And so there's more to be done, in terms of education, than we're doing now. But there's basic things that we haven't focused on, in my view.
And so what I've done in terms of trying to get—it used to be that—I was recently in his home State. I was recently out in—talking to my old buddy, the former leader of the House in Maine—from Maine—George Mitchell. And I got awarded when I left the Senate as being the most bipartisan Senator in the Senate—being able to get more done between Democrats and Republicans than any other member of the United States Senate. I'd only been there 36 years at that time. [Laughter]
But all kidding aside—but look what's happened. We barely talk to one another anymore, the way we address one another.
When I announced last time, I said I was running for three reasons. One, to restore the soul of this country. And by that, I meant the same thing that Jon Meacham was talking about—the Presidential historian—and that is a sense of decency. Just a sense of honor.
Think of the way we talk to one another. Think of the language used in our discourse—political discourse, public discourse.
You know, I ride by—as I ride through with the on the—what they call ""the Beast""—those big Cadillacs with those flags on it—all—I get an awful lot of people waving and hollering and wanting to say nice things. But you ride through certain areas, there's these big flags saying, ""Trump"" with ""f-u-c-k"" in the middle of it. And little kids standing there and giving you what we effectively referred to as ""the bird"" when we were kids. [Laughter] I mean, how far have we come?
So, look, one of the things that we did was to—secondly, and to reestablish access for middle class growth.
And thirdly, to bring the country together again, to unite the country.
And that's—the press is here. And the press understand—they've heard me say this before, and they're honest about how they cover everything. And that is that—they said that—I got wildly criticized by a lot of major reporters who have otherwise been fairly generous in their references to what I do. Because those days are gone.
If in a participatory democracy we can't bring people together, we're done. We're finished. We're finished as a democracy. And we're falling into camps—like warring camps. And so we've got to stop.
And so, look, here's what—in the first 2 years, we were in a situation where we brought inflation down by two-thirds. The Economist and the Wall Street Journal initially started off referencing Bidenomics with sort of tongue in cheek. Well, they're not doing that anymore about—it's no longer tongue in cheek.
The Bidenomics program is, we've built the economy from the middle out and the bottom up. And today, inflation is down two-thirds. And we've created 13 million jobs in 2 years and 800,000 manufacturing jobs; 3.5-percent uninflation [unemployment; White House correction], the lowest continuous rate in 55 years.
The American Rescue Plan vaccinated the Nation and got the economy moving again. We found ourselves in a position where the bipartisan infrastructure law—remember, we had—we're going have a excuse me. We were going to have investments in all our infrastructure—infrastructure month. We were going to have that on a monthly basis with the last guy. Nothing happened in 4 years.
Now we have—we have we have infrastructure decade. I got my colleagues in both parties to commit to a 10-year commitment to $1 trillion 300 billion. And guess what? It's attracted an awful lot of investment.
We've attracted private investment investing in America of over a half a trillion dollars—a half a trillion dollars. Many of you were part of that. We're in a situation where they're where we, as I said, the bipartisan infrastructure plan has already generated 37,000 projects. Here in Utah, 60,000 households already are getting affordable high-speed internet. We're in a situation with $28 million for Salt Lake City Airport to resurface the aging infrastructure.
I could go on across the country, but we're—and by the way, not many of my Republican colleagues voted for that piece of legislation. And so the—the distinguished Senator from Alabama—the former coach at the University of Alabama [Auburn University; White House correction]—he—I was fascinated to see him on television: ""And now I'm about to deliver to the State of Alabama one—billion two hundred and seventy million dollars in internet connectivity."" And he voted against it. [Laughter] I swear to God, he voted against it. So I suggested I go down and help him break ground for it. [Laughter]
But my point is, we're beginning to change. It's going to take time, because people don't know the changes that are taking place are a consequence of what we did yet. And it's going to take a little time for that to break through.
But if you think about it—look, you know, I—we found—and again, a lot of your business women and men. We found that supply chains matter and access to supply chains matter.
And what did we find out 2 years ago? Well guess what? We invented that little computer chip about the size of a—the end my finger here—my—the tip of my finger. We're the guys who came up with that idea—that little idea because of the because of the landing on the Moon. That's how we got that far.
And then we made it much more sophisticated. We used to have 40 percent of the market worldwide. Now it's down to 10 percent of the market. And guess what? When the supply chain has dried up because of pandemics in Asia and other places, what happened? Automobile prices skyrocketed, and we couldn't make any more—everything from your from your cell phone to your washer is—needs to run on these chips.
So I went over to Asia. And everybody thought I was little nuts. I spent some time with the South—with South Koreans. Got a little company called—[inaudible]—to invest $100 billion in America. So far we've gotten commitments for investments of over $268 billion in building these factories all across America. We're building one right here in your State.
These are things that are going to generate billions of dollars in revenue, put us in a position where we're not reliant any longer on other countries, and we're the source of being able to make sure we have all that we need.
We're in a circumstance now—for example, you know, I know there's no global warming. You all know that too. [Laughter] I know there's no global warming. But just in case there is a little global warming—what happened was: I had all the major automobile manufacturers on the South Lawn of the White House.
And Mary Barra, the president of General Motors, was suing the State of California for having a higher environmental standard than the Federal Government and said you couldn't do that.
Well, after our little meeting—I'm not saying it's because of me, but coincidentally, after our little meeting—[laughter]—she called me a week later, and she dropped the suit and said they're going to go all—half the entire production of vehicles by 2030 will be EV. And by 2035, 100 percent.
And you're finding that all across the board, because we have the means and the capability of doing it now. And it's going to fundamentally change the way in which we breathe the air.
We're able to—you know, I—everybody kids me about being ""Mr. Amtrak."" Well, I've traveled 1,200,000 miles on Amtrak—[laughter]—for real.
A little story: I—when I got elected, I got a phone call. My wife and daughter had been killed in an accident; my two boys weren't going to make it. And so I started to commute back and forth. I wasn't going to stay in Washington. And—but five Senators got together and said, ""Just stay 6 months."" And here I am. Anyway—but so I started commuting every day.
So I commuted every day for 36 years as a Senator when the Senate was in. I commuted every day, 300 miles a day, every single day. And I estimated—these conductors went back and got all this data, because they had a big dinner, and showed I averaged 119 days a year, 300 miles a day, et cetera. Then Vice President and—and so, I kind of like Amtrak. [Laughter]
But here's the point: We know if you can get on—if you can get from point A to point B on rail in the same time it takes to get in the vehicle, you take rail. It would save literally billions of gallons of oil if in fact we had—we expect—so we provided another $45 billion for rail. That's going to just getting underway. You're going to have—anyway, I won't go through the detail. But the generic point is pretty basic.
One of the other things we did—my dad used to say: At the end of the month, for the average, middle class family, it's—do you have—after you've paid all your bills, do you have enough left over to have just, what he'd say, ""a little breathing room""? Just a little breathing room.
And even when there's inflation, there's ways to provide breathing room by lowering costs on other items. Now, I have to admit to you—I hope I'm not going to offend any of you pharmacists, but the fact is that I think that we should be able to negotiate drug prices, because the VA does that now. And for Medicare, you—we negotiate those prices now.
Well, guess what? Any of you have type 2 diabetes or type 1 diabetes in your family? You were paying between $4- and $800 a month to for that insulin. It costs $10.20 to make it. The guy who invented it did not patent it because he wanted it available for everyone—never was patented. And, in addition to that, if you add the packaging costs, you get up to $13.
So we had a little study done. And guess what? You can buy the insulin now for $35. You make over 600- or 900-percent profit, but it's affordable.
We're negotiating drug prices so that, for example, by the end of 2025, no matter what your cost of your drugs—and some of the cancer drugs, as you all know—we're—all been victims of cancer in our families—are up to $8,000 a month. Well, guess what? You never have to pay more than a total of $2,000 a month for all your prescriptions.
And by the way, guess what? It saves the Government over—close to—well, it's a billion—excuse me, close to $1.8 trillion over time, because that's money we're not paying out from the Government to provide for this. Again, initially controversial, but now even the drug companies are moving along on a lot of this stuff independently.
The end result of a lot of these things—and by the way, the Inflation Reduction Act—I wish I hadn't called it that, because it has less to do with reducing inflation than it does to do with dealing with providing for alternatives that generate economic growth. And so we're now in a situation where if you take a look at what we're doing in the Inflation Reduction Act, we're literally reducing the cost of people being able to make their—meet their basic needs.
And, for example, we're in a situation where we're—and the—about the Medicare prices, but—well, I'm going to go on too long for you.
But look, some of my friends on the other team—and I met someone today who said: ""I'm a Republican. I'm voting for you. I have a program; I used to be on—[inaudible]."" And now he said, ""I'm voting for you."" I didn't ask why. [Laughter]
Any rate, during this process, I've been able to expand the amount—I made a commitment that one-third of all the land and waters of America will be in conservation by the time I left office—one-third. It's about 18 percent now.
But what's going on is that in the process of doing this, I'm told of all this incredible amount of money we spend. But guess what? I reduced the debt $1 trillion 700 billion, more than any President has ever—ever, ever—in American history.
So it's—this is not—some of it is rocket science, but it's not all rocket science. [Laughter] It's about growth. It's about generating growth.
And folks, you know, I just did an event for another thing I felt very, very strongly about. And granted, it was a little bit parochial, but I've been this way my whole career.
Anyway, my son was the attorney general of the State of Delaware. And he—his National Guard unit was deployed to Iraq, and he gave—you either—you're either Federal property or State property. So he gave up his seat as attorney general to go to Iraq for a year. He came back with a Bronze Star, the Conspicuous Service Medal, and a number of other—but he also came back having lived next to a burn pit for a total of a year. And he came back with stage 4 glioblastoma.
My generic point is this: We don't—we're—we have more veterans dying—more veterans today dying in the last 10 years from suicide than action in the field. More from suicide. And so one of the things we're doing and make sure we did is, we significantly increased the VA budget.
For example, many of those people—and if you know—you—I bet you know somebody who called and said: ""My son, my husband, my daughter, is having real problems. Can I get her in immediately?"" And they said, ""Well, we have an appointment in a week,"" or whatever. Not a joke. Seventeen soldiers a day committing suicide for the long time now.
So we set up this thing called the legislation that I put together relating to the issue of what the VA can and cannot do. And the legislation—I just was at a VA facility here in—in the State. And the end result is that we've fundamentally changed the way in which we deal with the VA and anyone who has maybe because I'm of the Vietnam generation: Remember Agent Orange? Well, the problem with Agent Orange was, you couldn't prove whatever you have was a consequence of Agent Orange.
Well, now there's an assumption: If you come back as a consequence of having cancer and having been exposed to these toxic wastes—just like in the 9/11 circumstance, where all those firemen, you know, died of cancer because of what they were doing—well, guess what? Now the families have access to opportunities. They lose the breadwinner in their family, and they can provide for up to $1,000 a month for kids who go on to school—to college. They can provide for a whole range of things to supplant what they lost as a consequence of these burn pits, which we generated.
We didn't deliberately do it. We didn't know we were doing it. But these are things the size of football fields, 8 to 10 feet deep, where you burn everything from toxic fuels to gas—a whole range of things.
I guess what I'm saying is that, you know, we've made some—what's—it's called the PACT Act. And it's really having a profound impact on the lives of millions of Americans—millions of Americans—who have been exposed.
Now, look, last thing I'll say, because I'm bouncing around too much for you here. I spent most of my time, as the Ambassador will tell you, dealing with American foreign policy. For years, I was the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee. And when I was Barack's Vice President, I handled a significant portion of the foreign policy we had to deal with because I knew all these people. I knew the heads of state from being around a long time.
And when I got elected, I took a look at what was happening. There was—NATO was breaking up. Putin has—was—and I checked with the intelligence community—was able to deconflict something so we wouldn't let sources and methods be known—and I predicted he would be invading Ukraine with 150,000—320,000 people. And he did. He came in, and he invaded Ukraine, because his—he was absolutely confident he could break up NATO—that NATO would not stick together.
I've had over 180 hours of meetings now with NATO heads of state, and from—most of them in person, initially—but on Zoom and with direct contact—and we've been able to hold NATO together. NATO is stronger today than it ever has been.
If I told you that Germany was going to increase its defense budget, I think you would have told me I was a little crazy. I think if you—if I told you—which I set out to do—we were able to do—that I was going to convince Japan they should increase their budget and help—directly help provide aid to Ukraine, you'd say, ""What the hell are they getting involved in Europe?"" Because the world is so damn small, you can't have tens of thousands of troops invade another country—and that's the largest invasion ever since World War II—and not expect it to spread around the world.
And so the bottom line is: We are working in that direction, so we've thus far, essentially, isolated Russia.
And we have China to deal with. And China is a ticking time-bomb in many cases. But it is—I'm the only one—now people are beginning to agree: China is in trouble. China was growing at 8 percent a year to maintain growth—and now closer to 2 percent a year.
China finds itself in a position where it's—it has the highest unemployment rate going. It's in a position where it's—the number of—the number of people who are of retirement age is larger than the number of people of working age. So they've got some problems. That's not good because when bad folks have problems, they do bad things.
So—but my point is managing China and managing that relationship. And I've spent more time with Xi Jinping than any world leader has. They've kept every—they keep tabs of all of it—68 hours of personally—just he and I with an interpreter each—and another 15 hours on Zoom.
And this is a guy who is a—who I think I understand. And this is a guy who—we're not looking for a fight with China. But we're looking for a rationale—a rational relationship to have with China.
I don't want to hurt China. But in the meantime, I watched what China was doing. So I put together a thing called the Quad. We brought together as an alliance India, Japan, Australia, and the United States. We put ourselves in a position where now we have the Philippines and, soon, Vietnam and Cambodia wanting to be part of a relationship with us because they're—they don't want to—they don't want to have a defense alliance, but they want relationships because they want China to know that they're not alone.
So a lot of things are changing, but nothing is done yet. We have to figure out how to deal with Africa. There is going to be a billion people on that continent very shortly. And there are—have some real problems.
But we have enormous opportunities to deal there too, as well. For example, we put together—or it became known as the Build Back Better initiative. We got together literally billions of dollars in the G-7 nations to provide for alternatives to China's—what they call Belt and Road Initiative, which is basically a debt and noose agreement that they have. There is not much going on. They're in real debt. They're going in trouble.
So I guess what I'm saying is, we have an enormous opportunity to bring the world together in different configurations than was before in a way that isn't threatening to others and provides a generic stability. And so we're spending a lot of time there. It's not done yet. We've got a lot more to do.
But my generic point is, I—if you read most of the foreign policy experts, you don't see a whole lot of criticism about the approach we've taken to try to deal with this—these changing pieces in—around the world. It's like, you know, when the North Pole, it doesn't melt—like it melts for real now. But you know, like icebergs break up and they—and when it gets cold, they reconfigure in a different way. That's what's happening around the world.
And so I guess what I'm trying to say to you is that I am optimistic we have an opportunity to leave our kids a world that is more secure, less contentious, and economically more sound than we found it. And I think that's the whole purpose of what I'm trying to do.
And so there is a lot of things that I have not spoken about, from opioids and mental health issues and a whole range of things.
But let me end by this: that I ran for office, as I told you, for those three reasons. And my MAGA Republican friends are trying to take us back—trying to take us back to places that the majority of Republicans don't want to go.
Although, I have— seven Senators that are still in the Senate—or more than that—than when I was there. I gave my word I'd never tell who they were, and I'll go to my grave without saying it. But seven of them—two together came once and then the other five came to me to say: ""I agree with you, Joe. But if I agree with you, then they're going to primary, and I'll lose my seat.""
And so, and you know a lot of your Republican friends aren't happy, but they're not sure—they're either scared of Biden and—or they're, in fact, worried that they'll cause great difficulty internally.
And so, you know, I truly believe this country is about to take off if we have a little more confidence in ourselves—just a little more confidence of what we're doing. Not being irrational about it, but realize who we are. We're the United States of America. There is not a damn thing we've ever set our mind to do we haven't been able to do—nothing when we've done it together.
But this division—this division is really, really hurting. And the investments we've made are transformative. And they're going to do something no one thought possible: actually generate real economic growth.
You see what's happening in Europe now. It's beginning to change. You see what's happening in—even in the Middle East. Mark my words: What's going—you're going to see changes in our relationships with everyone from Saudi Arabia to other countries, because they're all of a sudden realizing they've got problems if they don't change their ways a little bit.
So there's just a lot of reason for hope, but we still need a little bit of luck. And—but what we don't need—we don't need is an ""America first"" policy.
And a lot of you travel internationally. You won't do it now, but if you travel internationally in your business, raise your hand if you know any world leader in another part of the world you visit that says they want to see Trump come back. No, I'm not being facetious. Can you ever remember that—any other Presidents?
This is the United States of America. There's nothing beyond our capacity. We've got to do it together. And I think we can. I'm going to hush up. Thank you. [Laughter]

"August 10, 2023","Remarks on the First Anniversary of the Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxics (PACT) Act of 2022 in Salt Lake City, Utah","
Hello, hello, hello. Please, have a—take a seat if you have one.
Sarge, thank you for that introduction. You know, it's important for two reasons. One, I have been in and out of Iraq and Afghanistan over 38 times. And I don't think most people know—this audience may know—how many women we have in combat, how many women are not only doing their part, but doing jobs that most people didn't think women would do or could do.
And the Sarge is an example of just that. You know, a Black Hawk helicopter is a—anyway. I won't go into it all. But the point is that, you know, Sarge, you—what happened to you has happened to thousands of people. The Gov and I talked about that earlier—the Governor and I—about what we're doing here.
You know, you and your fellow veterans are the heart, the soul, and the very spine and sinew of this generation. I mean, that's a fact. You know, only 1 percent of you volunteer to protect all of us. That's what it is. And it's all volunteer.
And I want to thank Dr. Angela Williams and the great team here at the Salt Lake City VA for hosting us and for taking care of our heroes.
Mayor Erin Mendenhall, thank you for the passport into the city. I appreciate that opportunity.
And, Governor Spencer Cox, thank you for your hospitality. But much more importantly, thank you for taking care of our veterans and for bringing along your beautiful family.
And by the way, you know, years ago—this is a little ad lib here. But years ago, when John Kerry was the nominee for the—for President of the Democratic Party, he talked with me about the possibility of being Vice President and—on his ticket. And I wasn't—we just—it was a—we were old friends. I said no, I didn't want to be Vice President.
But had I known that as Vice President, I get Secret Service, and had I known that meant my daughters had Secret Service—[laughter]—and my granddaughters, I would have fought even harder for him at the time. [Laughter]
And now my—I have a bunch of grandchildren. They all have Secret Service, and my daughter has Secret Service. And you know, it's just wonderful. [Laughter] I'm not sure what they think about it, but it's just wonderful.
Any rate, thank you very, very much.
Wildfires in Maui, Hawaii 
And look, before I begin, I want to say a word about the devastating wildfires that have claimed at least 36 lives in Maui, in Hawaii. I—we have just approved a major disaster declaration of—for Hawaii, which will get aid into the hands of the people desperate—desperately needing help now. They've lost—anyone who's lost a loved one, whose home has been damaged or destroyed is going to get help immediately.
And I've directed that we surge support to these brave firefighters and first responders and emergency personnel working around the clock risking their lives.
I just got off the phone, before I got here, for a long conversation with Governor Josh Green this morning and let him know I'm going to make sure the State has everything it needs from the Federal Government to recover.
The FEMA Administrator Griswell [Criswell; White House correction] will be in Miami tomorrow—in Maui tomorrow. And I've directed her to streamline any process which requests for help and survivors registered for immediate Federal assistance without delay. FEMA is surging disaster assistance personnel on the island, and they're going to help survivors get access to Federal assistance.
And you know, anybody who wants to know out there where to go—if this is televised—that they can go to disasterassistance.gov—disasterassistance.gov—to learn if you're eligible for assistance.
And I've ordered all available Federal assets on the island—including the U.S. Coast Guard, the Navy 3d Fleet, and the U.S. Army—to assist local emergency response crews from the—along with the Hawaiian National Guard. We're working as quickly as possible to fight these fires and evacuate residents and tourists.
In the meantime, our prayers are with the people of Hawaii, but not just our prayers—every asset we have will be available to them. And we've seen—they've seen their home, their business destroyed, and some have lost loved ones. And it's not over yet.
Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxics (PACT) Act of 2022 
But now for the reason I'm here today. I've said it many times before—when I started saying it 30 years ago, I got criticized occasionally for saying it. I said: We have many obligations as a nation, but we only have one truly sacred obligation, and that's to equip those we send into harm's way and care for them and their families when they come home and when they don't.
One year ago today, we met that sacred obligation when I signed—after fighting so damn hard for the PACT Act—to sign it into law. And I want to thank all the veterans organizations for helping make that happen, because it matters.
The PACT Act is one of the most significant laws ever signed to help veterans exposed to toxic materials and their—help their families recover as well as receive compensation.
You remember what we mean by burn pits. You know, when we first using the phrase ""burn pits,"" people kind of looked at us. But a burn pit is what you saw—basically, the giant burn pit, the first one everybody was aware of, was in 9/11 when the buildings came down. Remember all those firemen that died of cancer and how we—they got covered? Well, when firefighters first responded, that's what happened.
Now, the burn pits in Iraq—where we're talking about—and in other countries—in Afghanistan, even in parts of—throughout the Middle East—they're the size of football fields. A hundred—up to 100 yards long, 20 yards to 30 yards wide, and 8 to 10 feet deep. And everything you can imagine is thrown into these pits to incinerate them—the wastes of war: tires, poisonous chemicals, jet fuel, and so much more. Toxic smoke thick with poison spreads through the air and into the lungs of our troops in their hooches, where they lived nearby these facilities.
I know. I've been. I've been there in Iraq and Afghanistan. I've seen them. And you can smell it in the air. You can sometimes see it.
And when these troops came home—many of them the fittest and best trained warriors that we ever sent anywhere—were exposed to these burn pits, they weren't the same. And thousands of troops and their—they had to live in their hooches not far from—proximity from these burn pits.
The one in Iraq—my son was about 400 yards from one of the burn pits, living there for a year in his hooch. They breathe that toxic material sometimes for months at a time—in the case of my son and his buddies, for an entire year—causing headaches, numbness, dizziness, cancer.
This is not about my son, but just an example of how close it was. My son Beau was one of those—[inaudible]. He went the fittest guy in his unit and came home and—and he came home, but died of glioblastoma. It's personal for my family, but it's also personal for so many of you.
Under Secretary—Secretary of the VA McDonough and I just had a long talk. He couldn't be here today, but he can tell you we're determined to address this problem come hell or high water and compensate these veterans and their families who have suffered from the consequence of this tragedy.
It was part of my unity agenda, as I called it, when I did my first State of the Union—last State of the Union to try to bring the country together on things I thought we all could agree on.
First was beating the opioid epidemic, and we're working like hell on that. Tackling the mental health crisis, and there is a mental health crisis in America. Supporting our veterans—supporting our veterans.
Look, I delivered that speech in March of last year. And a few months later in August, with veterans groups making the case and never giving up, the bipartisan PACT Act was on my desk to sign into law. And don't tell me we can't get things done when we work together. Democrats and Republicans worked together to get that done.
In particular, I want to thank Senator Jon Tester, the chair of the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee, and Representative Mark Taka—excuse me, Takano, as well, the ranking member of the House Veterans Affairs Committee, for their leadership. They never stop fighting on behalf of the veterans and their families.
We learned a horrible lesson after Vietnam: how harmful effects of exposure to Agent Orange took years to manifest themselves in veterans, leaving too many veterans unable to access care when they needed it and deserved it. And we had—they had to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that that was the cause of their problem, which was difficult to prove in the long term.
That's why I supported the Agent Orange Act of 1991 supporting veterans exposed to the harmful substances in Vietnam.
Well, I didn't want to see that again. The PACT Act means today's veterans and their families won't suffer those same painful, frustrating delays and denials.
And here's what it—the law does: It empowers the Veterans Administration, the VA, to move quicker to determine if a veteran qualifies for the benefits of the law—benefits like monthly disability compensation and regular toxic exposure screenings.
It also means new facilities, new research, and more health care workers at VA hospitals. It includes nearly—and one of the veterans raised this with me today—nearly $30 million for new outpatient clinics right here in Salt Lake City. Right here.
And for families who have suffered the ultimate loss, it means potential access to life insurance, tuition benefits for their surviving family members, home loan assistance, and monthly stipends—which cannot replace one bread—one of the breadwinners in their home, but it sure in hell can help.
For example, a surviving spouse of a veteran who died from toxic illness with two children could be eligible for roughly $2,300 a month for the rest of his or her life. I'm proud to announce that over 340,000 veteran survivors are already benefiting from the law just 1 year after it was signed, including over 2,000 veterans here in Utah.
Veterans are getting the—[applause]—veterans are getting the care they deserve in every corner of the country. For example, there's an Army veteran who served in Iraq now receiving care for prostate cancer via the—at the VA in Seattle. He heard about the PACT Act, and he applied for benefits the day I signed the law. Because he's already a VA patient, he didn't need to submit medical records or get separate exams. His application was approved, and he's now received retroactive payments from the date the law was signed.
Another Army veteran, now in New Hampshire National Guard, with multiple deployments to Iraq and Kuwait learned that he had a that a friend and soldier she deployed with were diagnosed with breast cancer. Just in case, she decided to get a toxic exposure screening free at all veterans enrolled in the VA health care. She too was diagnosed with breast cancer. They caught the cancer early, and she's currently being treated for it. And she's been granted 100 percent service-connected eligibility under the PACT Act, tripling her monthly payment benefits.
For—folks, it matters. This matters. Folks, we have a moral obligation. This goes beyond the financial. We have a moral obligation to respond to this. And I'm here today to spread the word so every veteran or surviving family member knows how to access benefits of this law.
And because these conditions have already taken such a toll on so many veterans and their families, I directed the Department of Veterans Affairs to treat all 23 presumptive conditions in this law as applicable immediately, like chronic bronchitis—chronic bronchitis; asthma; many types of cancer, including any type of reproductive cancer; and something we have been fighting for for a long time: veterans-era veterans—Vietnam-era veterans are entitled to compensation for hypertension.
This is now the law. And let me give you an example of why it matters.
The widow of a 28-year Army veteran in Connecticut applied for survivor benefits after her husband died from gastrointestinal cancer. That was before the PACT Act was passed, and her claim was denied. In April of this year, she learned about the PACT Act and reapplied. One month later, because of her husband's cancer, she's now presumed to be a service-connected under the PACT Act. She—claim was approved. Now, she's eligible for survivor's compensation for her son and further his education and the GI Bill.
I'm urging veterans from these decades of war in Vietnam, and Iraq, Afghanistan to enroll in the VA health care, to get screened for toxic exposure, and to promptly file your claim. And for those watching this home—at home, visit VA.gov/PACT—p-a-c-t. VA.gov—I want to say it again—VA.gov/PACT. File a claim or apply for VA health care now.
Or go to your local VA hospital and reach out to the veterans service organization—like Disabled American Veterans, American Legion, the Wounded Warriors Project, the Veterans of Foreign Wars—if you need additional assistance. There is no deadline to submit a claim. But if you want to be eligible to receive retroactive benefits for last year, you have to sign up by Monday.
So apply today. The VA will move as quickly as possible to resolve your claim and get the benefits you deserve.
We're also taking other important steps to help the Nation's veterans and servicemembers. We're helping connect veterans to registered apprentice programs so they can transfer the skills they learned in the military to good-paying jobs here at home, now that we're having the largest building boom in 40 years.
The VA is launching a Transition Assistance grant program for organizations that help veterans and their spouses find jobs when they leave the military. The unemployment rate for veterans has hit an alltime low. It is now at 2.8 percent—[applause]—2.8 percent. And we're damn proud of that. We've made that a priority since we got into office.
This spring, I signed an Executive order directing the VA to cut redtape and give veterans who need assistance at home more flexibility in picking who will be their caregiver.
Earlier this summer, I went to North Carolina, and I signed an Executive order at Fort Liberty. It's—calls the most comprehensive set of administrative actions in the history of this—and to support the economic security of military veterans, their spouses, caregivers, and survivors—like making it easier for a military spouse to find a job in the Federal Government, expanding access to childcare for military families.
You know, when I first took office, I signed the American Rescue Plan, which invested $17 billion for veterans health care, including mental health care and suicide prevention, to deal with the fact that more veterans—more veterans—have been and continue to die of suicide than in battle over the past two decades. More veterans die of suicide.
And all the stories I heard in my home State—people would call up and be looking for help. ""My husband, he needs help. He needs""—and couldn't get through. ""We'll get back to you."" Seventeen—seventeen—a day dying of suicide nationwide. Seventeen a day. Even one veteran dying of suicide, particularly because you couldn't get the help immediately, is one too many.
The VA is doing everything it can do, including expanding mental health screening, increasing access to legal and financial support, hiring more mental health professionals, which was one—where—where's my commander that was here?—one that you brought up. We're hiring more. We're hiring.
Including through a proven program that recruits veterans to help other veterans understand what they're going through to get the help they need.
I can notice—if you can stop for another second. You know, one of the things about the military, you're taught to be tough, stand alone, do what you need to do. And it's awful hard when you're having problems and you think you have a mental health problem to ask for help. It's really hard.
There is no difference between having a mental health problem and breaking your arm or your leg. No difference. And you should not be worried about asking for help any more than you would if you had broke your leg. We have to make sure people know there's nothing to be ashamed of in seeking that help.
You know, think about this. I don't know how many—of my tens of thousands of miles that I've traveled through war zones, I don't know anybody who would not wonder whether or not what these veterans have seen caused—could cause posttraumatic stress. It's enormous. It's an enormous problem. They just need help to get through this.
We're working to the end veterans homelessness as well. No one should be homeless in this country, especially not those who served it. Period.
Last year, the VA found permanent housing for over 40,000 veterans and set a goal of permanently housing at least another 38,000 this year. And I'm proposing that the Congress join in and triple the number of rental assistance vouchers for extremely low-income veterans—[applause]—now. Now. Now.
In securing a bipartisan budget agreement earlier this summer and preventing an economic collapse, we stopped draconian cuts in veteran services. That agreement including dedicated funding for our veterans health so that the health care of those who served so bravely in this country won't be used as a bargaining chip going forward to try to get other things cut.
The agreement also fully funds the PACT Act and expands nutrition benefits that will now be available to our veterans. After serving this Nation, no veteran should go hungry. No veteran should go hungry.
Just 2 weeks ago, I signed an Executive order to significantly strengthen how the military handles sexual assault. We're moving the authority for addressing sexual assault claims to a specialized independent military unit outside the chain of command. That was a long time in coming. But it's a big deal.
And we all owe a thanks to Senator Gillibrand in New York for her leadership in this because she did not give up until she got it done.
And there is more to do. But we've made a lot of progress. And we've got to keep going.
Let me close to this. After I signed the PACT Act into law last August, I handed the pen—there is a tradition when you sign a piece of legislation, particularly a significant piece, you have the people who are responsible for getting it done for you on the stage with you when you sign it. And you traditionally give the pen to the most consequential person who helped that happen.
We got finished, and I signed—the pen to the widow and daughter of Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson, a veteran for whom the bill was named. His widow was also my wife's guest at the State of the Union. A family that suffered the greatest of losses, but turned their pain into purpose.
And I handed the pen not to the mother, but to Sergeant Robinson's little girl. A lovely little kid sitting next to me. And she looked at me, and she said: ""Thank you for my daddy."" ""Thank you for my daddy."" I think she was talking for all of us, everyone who fought so hard and came together to keep our promise to the veterans and to keep faith with our heroes. That's courage. That's character.
That's who all of you are. Not hyperbole. I want to thank you all—Democrat, Republican, Independents—for your work to get this bill to my desk and to get it signed.
As I said, I was going to sign that bill come hell or high water, no matter how long I had to keep the Congress in.
It's just another reminder of what we know to be true: We are the United States of America. There's nothing—nothing—beyond our capacity when we decide to work together to get it done. We never fail when we do that. Never on any major issue.
So God bless you all. And let's continue to work together. And God save our veterans.
Thank you.

"August 09, 2023","Remarks at the Arcosa Wind Towers, Inc., Manufacturing Facility in Belen, New Mexico","
The President. Hey, folks. This—this is a team sport. It's a team sport. I'm going to talk about that in a minute.
Thank you for the nice comments.
Arcosa, Inc., President and Chief Executive Officer Antonio Carrillo. Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you.
The President. Antonio—please if you have a seat, take it. [Laughter] Antonio, thank you for that introduction and for hosting us here today.
Governor, you are the very—where are you sitting?
Audience member. Over here!
The President. You're the very best, kid. You're the best. [Laughter] No, no, no, no, that's a fact. You're the best. I love you. Thank you. Thank you.
And, Senator Heinrich, I tell you what, I'm glad—I was a flanker back. I'm glad I didn't have you on the other side as a tight end. [Laughter] But good to see you, man. Thank you. And thank your whole family. It was great to meet them.
And that guy sitting next to you—you know, I have—Ben Ray Luján. I don't know where he came from, but I tell you what—[laughter]—I told him I'm prepared to help in terms of making sure that those folks are taken care of, by the way. Over at—[applause].
And Representative Stansbury, God love you, kid. I tell you what. [Laughter] You are really doing a great job. Thank you for all your cooperation. And thanks for your advice and your help.
And Teresa Leger Fernández, who isn't here today, but they're——
Audience members. She's over here!
The President. Well, there—yes, what am I thinking? I thought you had to leave. [Laughter]
By the way, her son there—I tell you what, I'd keep an eye on him. I may be calling him Mr. President someday. I don't know.
Gabe is the one who couldn't be here today. He's the incredible—you have an incredible congressional delegation—you really do—here. First rate. You really do.
And thanks to all the Tribal leaders for being here. I just want you to know, I was raised by a guy most of you don't know. He was a wonderful, wonderful man and a great friend. His name was Danny Inouye. And he said, ""Joe, it's 'Indian Nations.'"" He taught me early on. Early on. But thank you, thank you, thank you for all you've done.
We had a good day yesterday in your neighboring State of Arizona. I was able to put away just about a million acres of sacred land. [Applause] I know. That's good stuff.
You know, I got so tired, over the last 15 years—and this is a little story I want to tell you about why I'm so—I was telling the team here: I've never been—I've been a—I know I don't look it, but I've been around a long time. [Laughter] But I've never been more optimistic in my whole career than I am today about America's prospects in both foreign and domestic policy.
You know, went through an awful long time watching companies, in the last 15 years, decide to invest overseas because the labor was cheaper, shutting down factories all across America—all across America.
And I asked myself: Why do we have to put up with that? We're sending jobs abroad and importing products at home. We knew we could change it. I just knew we could change that. We have the best workers in the world.
And my team—[applause]—no, and my team and I decided—you know, if you'll hold here—there's a law that was passed in the thirties. It says any money that Congress sends me to—to spend, I can insist that it all be spent on American products with American workers. No President has paid much attention to that in any—in either party. But guess what? I'm paying attention.
As a simple proposition—I mean this sincerely, from the bottom of my heart—we decided we're going to invest in America. And this company is a great example.
They're now poised to be the leader in the wind industry. But a few years ago, they were laying off workers because we weren't investing in them. So we passed a significant climate legislation not only that moves us away from fossil fuels to a—cleaner technologies like wind, but it means we're going to make things and new technology here in America.
And there's no reason—[applause]. There's no reason why we can't do it. We have the best educated—we have the most advanced technology in the world. Why are we not doing that? That's basically what we're talking about today when we talk about investing in America.
So today I want to talk about the—our progress in growing the economy from the middle out and the bottom up, not the top down.
I came to office determined to move away from trickle-down economics—I—not a whole lot trickled down on my dad's kitchen table when we were growing up—and focus instead on the middle class, because the middle class built America. And guess what? Guess what? And unions built the middle class. That's not hyperbole. That's a fact.
And, folks—and when the middle class—I'm a capitalist. When the middle class does well, everybody does well. The poor have a way up, and the rich were able to be very rich. Just make sure they pay a little more of their taxes.
Audience members. Yes!
The President. But look, the Financial Times and the Wall Street Journal have started to call—have started to call my plan ""Bidenomics."" Initially, I don't think they meant it with a great deal of respect. [Laughter] With all due respect for them, our plan is working. It's working.
The economy has grown since I took office. It grew faster in the last quarter than anyone expected. And you know, we created over 13 million brandnew jobs since I took office—13 million in less than 3 years. Ninety thousand new jobs right here in New Mexico. Eight hundred thousand manufacturing jobs nationwide—800,000.
And I know that you're tired of hearing me say this, but where is it written that America can't lead the world again in manufacturing? Because we're going to do just that: the leading manufacturer in the world.
It's not like this is—these are facts. It's not hyperbole. We've created more jobs in 2 years than any President in American history has in a 4-year term.
Unemployment has been below 4 percent for the longest period stretch in 50 years of American history. And not only have we recovered all the jobs we lost during the pandemic, we now have more jobs than we did before the pandemic.
Because unemployment's been so low for so long, workers aren't just finding more jobs. They're able to look for better jobs at higher pay. And according to the research surveys, job satisfaction in America is higher than it's been in the last 36 years. Look, the share of working—the share of working-age Americans with jobs is as high as it's been in 20 years. That's never happened under my predecessor.
So where are we now? Well, unemployment is down, and so is inflation. Remember all the experts, including some that worked for me, told us that to get inflation under control we needed to lower wages and reduce the number of people working. No, I'm—that—that's been sort of gospel. [Laughter] Not a joke. Seriously. Some of you here in the audience are economists. You know that.
But I never bought it—the problem was, too many people are working or working people are working—making too much money. That's not the problem.
There is a lot of reasons for inflation is up. First, the pandemic. Second, the war in Ukraine. Third, broken supply chains.
Now, one reason we've seen inflation fall by two-thirds without losing jobs is, we're seeing corporate profits come back down to earth.
We have more to do, but inflation is now at its lowest point in 2 years. In fact, we have the lowest rate of inflation among the world's major economies. No other economy—major economy in the world is—inflation as low as we are. It's down from 9 percent to 3 percent.
There is a lot more work to do. I'm not satisfied with where it is. More work ahead—the Washington Post recently suggested in an—front-page article—I think it was front page—that, quote, ""Republicans may have to find something else to criticize Biden for now that inflation is coming down."" [Laughter] I'm sure they'll find something. [Laughter]
At the same time, pay for low-wage workers has grown at the fastest pace in over two decades, and wages are growing faster than inflation. And we're continuing to make progress in fixing the supply chains.
For example, we couldn't access semiconductors during the pandemic because the factories making them overseas were shut down. We all know semiconductors are those little small computer chips about the size of the end of your fingertip that affect nearly everything in our lives, from cell phones to automobiles, refrigerators, to the most sophisticated weapons system, including the systems that Los Alamos and Sandia National Laboratories provide for our national security.
America invented these chips. We invented them when we went to the Moon. We made them work better. We made them more sophisticated. But over time, we went from producing nearly 40 percent of those chips—the world's chips—down to 10 percent. That's why I designated and I signed—and I insisted that it be written and passed—the CHIPS and Science Act exactly almost 1 year ago today. Very short—[applause].
Now, all over the country, semiconductor companies are investing in a record billions of dollars. By the way, do you know how much has been committed in the CHIPS and Science Act to be invested in America? Two hundred and thirty billion dollars. Two hundred and thirty billion dollars to bring chip production—to bring chip production—back home in Ohio, New York, Arizona, and right here in New Mexico.
Look, just a few years ago, Intel cut 700 jobs at its semiconductor fab in Rio Rancho. Now they're expanding their fab with a $3.5 billion investment, creating 700 new jobs, many of which won't require a college degree.
And by the way, that's over $200 billion. They're building fabs. They're just called factories. They're the size of a football field, not much wider than this. And guess what? Average salary is about 130,000 grand. And guess what? You don't need a college degree. Make over $100,000—it's about time. And, folks, unions are building the structures as well.
Look, folks, that's Bidenomics.
Since I took office, we have attracted over a half a trillion dollars—half a trillion dollars—in private investment in manufacturing and industries of the future right here in America.
According to Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs and Wall Street, my ""Invest in America"" agenda is leading to a boom in manufacturing investment. Spending on construction for manufacturing plants nearly doubled in the last 2 years after growing only 2 percent the previous 4 years.
Last quarter, factory construction contributed more to the gross domestic product than any time in 40 years—40 years. Instead of exporting American jobs, we're creating American jobs, and we're exporting American products. And we're seeing it right here in America. We're seeing it in New Mexico as well.
In 2008, Solo cup factory shut down right here, right where we're standing. Two hundred people lost their jobs. Nearly a decade and a half later, a plastics company bought the site. It shut down after 3 years, laying off a hundred workers. It's been idle ever since.
Now, it's coming alive again. Arcosa makes wind turbines—wind towers. Those—that's the thing that holds—most—when I say that, people think at me like wind tower—you all know what a wind tower is. They look at my like, ""What the hell is a wind tower?"" [Laughter]
That's a key component. You know, you have to have it to hold up those—you know how long—by the way, I was in Eastern Colorado looking at the blades manufacturer. Those blades are a hundred and three yards long, longer than a football field. And by the way, they don't cause cancer. [Laughter]
And by the way, wind energy is cheaper than fossil fuel. Solar energy is cheaper.
A few years ago, business took a turn, and they were forced to lay off 200 employees at plants all across America. Now, thanks to the new law I signed making historic investments in clean energy, business is booming again.
By the way, that—they call it the Inflation Reduction Act, but within that is the act relating to the climate, and it's $368 billion. And when I passed that, not one single guy on the other team voted for it. Nobody voted for it on the other team.
Since I signed that law—bill into law, Arcosa has received $1.1 billion in orders for new wind towers. And today we're here breaking ground on a new plant that's going to create 250 new good-paying jobs.
And meanwhile, we're speeding up permitting for transmission lines so wind energy produced by these towers reaches people's homes. Because what's happening now is, it's hard to get at these—a lot of these towers are old. And everybody is: ""Not in my neighborhood."" They don't want a big new tower going up.
So we're strengthening the towers, and we're going to go underground. It costs six times as much to go underground, but we're learning how to do that more cheaply so it doesn't cause the forest fires and all the things that happen when major wind storms knock these lines down.
My administration recently completed a review of a proposed SunZia line to transportation energy from a planned—a planned wind farm here in New Mexico and Arizona and California. So you're going to generate the wind here—I mean, the energy here—and be able to transmit it all the way across Arizona and into California as well.
These projects are expected to create 2,000 new construction jobs and up to 150 permanent jobs, providing clean energy for up to 3 million Americans—3 million—[applause]—and reducing the pressures of climate change.
Like I said, Bidenomics is about bringing supply chains back home.
Arcosa makes wind towers that's going to go into turbines made by GE Verona—excuse me, I mispronounced it: Vernova—in Florida and New York. Pattern Energy will use these turbines to build the largest wind farms in the Western Hemisphere, spanning Lincoln, Torrance, and San Miguel Counties in New Mexico. And SunZia will use that energy to power homes all across the Southwest.
That's Bidenomics. It's cheaper. It's cheaper. That's what we're talking about: investing in America.
You know, this company says the investing they're making here is a direct result of the law we signed almost exactly a year ago, the most significant investment in clean energy and combating the existential threat of climate change ever, anywhere in the world. Like I said, it's $368 billion.
And Governor Lujan Grisham is leading the way, launching New Mexico's community solar program so families will save money on electric bills; stopping leaks of superpolluting methane from oil and gas operations—we're capping thousands of those wells all across America, beginning in Eastern—Western Pennsylvania and coming east—coming west; and putting New Mexico on a path for a cleaner, cheaper electric transmission future as well in this State.
Folks, when I think jobs—when I think climate, I think jobs. I don't think all the dangers—there's real danger, but the jobs to fix the problem—my mother used to have an expression. After I lost my wife and daughter, she was trying to console me. She said, ""Joey, out of anything bad, something good will happen if you look hard enough for it."" Well, all across America, we're looking. There are going to be—a lot of good things are going to happen as a consequence of this problem we're facing.
What Arcosa is doing here is part of a much broader clean energy manufacturing. It's going to happen in big cities and rural communities as well. Like in Colorado, where CS Wind broke ground on what will be the world's largest wind tower manufacturing plant.
And, coincidentally, CS Wind is Congresswoman Lauren Boebert—you know that very quiet Republican lady? [Laughter] It's in her district. Who, along with every other Republican, voted against this bill. And it's making all this possible. And she railed against its passage. But that's okay, she's welcoming it now.
When I ran for office, I promised to be President for all Americans. Whether you live in a blue State or a red State, I'm going to keep my promise.
Before we made these historic clean energy investments, Siemens Corporation laid off workers who were making wind turbine parts and put the plant in Iowa and Kansas into what they now call—they refer to as ""hibernation."" I hibernated in a while—a—you know, Iowa for a while. But look, now they're reopening both these plants and rehiring workers.
In New York, GE is investing $50 million for a new manufacturing assembly line making critical components for turbines in partnership with organized labor.
Every one of these companies has pointed to the clean energy law that we originated and I signed as a reason for making these investments. And we're making sure rural communities are benefiting from these historic investments as well. It's not just urban areas.
We're investing over $160 million in New Mexico to support conservation and climate-smart agriculture and forestry, like improved water management or grazing livestock in ways that improve soil health, helping farmers and ranchers get paid for doing the right thing, planting material that absorbs carbon from the air and not just—look, we've launched the Rural Partners Network, placing Federal employees on the ground in New Mexico to help rural communities take advantage of the Federal resources. So they're there and can—because this is all new stuff. People on the ground to say: ""Here's how you do it. This is what you do.""
Building an economy from the bottom up and the middle out means strengthening our rural economy so farmers and ranchers and their children don't have to leave home to find opportunities for work.
Where I come from, it's all about pride. It's all about restoring pride, being able to make a living in the community you love and where you were raised and not have to leave.
Folks, this is all part of my plan. The plan is to invest in America. We're transforming our country, including by rebuilding America's infrastructure.
We used to have the best infrastructure in the world. We were number one in the world. That's ports, railroads, airports, roads, everything. You know what we are now? We're number 13 in the world. China used to be number eight. Now they're number two.
How can you have the best economy in the world with a second-rate infrastructure? It's not possible.
And through the bipartisan infrastructure law, we already announced over 37,000 projects in 4,500 communities all across America, including $3.6 billion in investments right here in New Mexico. So far. We're just getting started.
For example, the city of Albuquerque is getting $25 million to rebuild the Uptown Transit Center, making it safer, more accessible, and easier for folks to get uptown and helping transform the area into a vibrant community hub.
We're investing $160 million in Eastern New Mexico Rural Water System to build a new transmission pipeline, providing a critical water supply to nearly 70,000 people, from Clovis to Portales to Cannon—to, excuse me, Cannon Air Force Base.
Look, right now over 114,000 homes and small businesses across New Mexico don't have access to high-speed internet. We're investing over $1 billion in this State to connect every corner of this State, especially rural communities and family farms, with affordable internet.
So people sometimes say, ""Why are you doing that?"" Imagine if a long time—Roosevelt and the telephones came along and said, ""We're not going to help invest in telephones."" Come on, man. [Laughter] I don't know what the hell we're thinking.
Already, we're saving nearly 170,000 New Mexico families $30 a month on their internet bills so far. We're making investments like this all across the country.
I'll just—if I could pause for another second. There is a distinguished Senator from the State of Alabama who used to be a pretty good football coach, and he's railed against this legislation. And then I noticed he had a big announcement: ""Alabama is going to get a billion two hundred million dollars for internet."" And I thought: ""Wait a minute. Didn't he rail against that for a long, long time?"" I was inclined to go down and help him celebrate, but I decided not to. [Laughter]
Look, we can see exactly where we're making these investments, and you can see exactly where they are if you go to invest.gov. You'll know exactly where every one of these investments is going throughout America.
These investments create thousands of good-paying jobs. And we're making sure workers have the skills to do the jobs. For example, in New Mexico, we're funding the mobile training unit run by the plumbers and pipefitters union, UA Local 412. It's going to train plumbers and pipefitters and HVAC workers with a focus on training Latino workers, Indigenous people, and people recovering from substance abuse.
And I know you're probably thinking what a lot of our very conservative Republican friends: ""Biden is spending all this money, man. My taxes are going to go up."" Unless you make more than $400,000 a year, your Federal taxes aren't going to go up a single penny.
And guess what? I did all this without raising anybody's taxes in the middle class. And one other little thing: During this process, I cut the Federal budget in 2 years by $1.7 trillion. One-point-seven—the largest anyone has ever done in 2 years. The last guy increased the national debt by 40 percent.
Folks, we've done all this without raising taxes on the middle class, and I promise we'll never raise Federal tax on anyone making less than $400,000 a year. I've kept that promise, and I'm going to keep it, unlike my—unlike the last President.
And as I said, my first 2 years in office, the Federal deficit fell by $1.7 trillion.
Audience member. Thank you, Joe!
The President. And we got what we promised. We can cut the Federal deficit and still do all the rest of this.
Folks, every one of my friends on the other team in Congress voted against the clean energy investments. And the vast majority voted against the bipartisan infrastructure law. But that hasn't stopped them from claiming credit now that billions of dollars and thousands of jobs are coming into their States.
Like I said at the State of the Union Address, I'll see them at the groundbreakings. [Laughter]
Look, let me close with this. I'm not here to declare victory on the economy. We have a lot more work to do, but we have a plan, and it's turning things around. Bidenomics is just another way of saying: restore the American Dream.
Forty years of trickle-down economic policy limited the dream to those at the top. But I believe every American willing to work hard should be able to get a job no matter where they live—in the heartland, small towns—to raise their kids on a good paycheck and be able to keep their roots where they grew up.
My dad used to have a saying, and I mean this sincerely—he'd say: ""Joey, a job is about a lot more than a paycheck. It's about your pride; it's about dignity."" And he meant it. Not a joke. It's about dignity. It's about being able to look your kid in the eye and say, ""Honey, it's going to be okay."" It's the being able to say—you think I'm kidding, but I—some of you—some of the folks in Congress knew my dad. He meant it.
And he said: ""The real question, Joey, is, at the end of the month, is there—after you pay all your bills, is there any—anything left? Do you have a little breathing room—just a little bit of breathing room?""
Well, folks, that's part of the American Dream. And that's Bidenomics. It's rooted in what has always worked best in this country: investing in America, invest in Americans. Because when we invest in our people, when we strengthen the middle class, we have stronger economic growth that benefits everybody—the poor, the wealthy, everybody.
And for the longest time, we've been told to give up on American manufacturing, that it can't happen again, and we just can't do it anymore. Well, as you might have noticed, I've never believed that. As I said, America used to lead the world in manufacturing, and we're going to do it again.
I can honestly say I've never been more optimistic about America's future. Just remember who we are: We are the United States of America. And there is nothing—nothing beyond—I mean it sincerely. Think of any objective we've set as a goal that we've ever not met. Name one. No matter what it is, we've never, never, never—when we've worked together—failed. Nothing is beyond our capacity if we work together.
And God bless you all, and may God protect our troops. Thank you so much.

"August 08, 2023","Remarks at a Campaign Reception in Albuquerque, New Mexico","
The President. Thank you, thank you, thank you. Well, Randi, you know, it's a good thing you're not doing this overseas. Every time I go overseas, you know how many people have to travel with me? [Laughter] Nine hundred.
Audience members. Whoa!
The President. And—but like you said, you and my wife agree: They're too damn nice looking—most of them. That's what worries me. [Laughter]
But all kidding aside, thank you very much. Look, it's one thing to come to a fundraiser, which I truly appreciate—to do a fundraiser. It's another thing to have one in your home, and it takes over everything. So thank you, thank you, thank you.
And, you know, the Governor has been a good friend since I got engaged in running. And she's done a hell of a job in the House, and she's done a hell of a job here as Governor. And we come from the same value set.
You know, I said I was running the first time for three reasons, even as my campaign staff thought it was—I was off base. The first one, I said I want to restore the soul of America, this sense of decency we used to have when Fred and I worked together. Fred, we used to argue like hell—not Fred and I.
And, by the way, I want to personally thank Fred Harris, because when I got elected—[applause]—thank you—when I got elected as a kid in 1972, I thought the world had come to me. And I was down in Washington borrowing Teddy Kennedy's office, hiring staff. I wasn't old enough to be sworn in yet. You had to be 30 to be sworn in, and I was waiting to be constitutionally eligible. And I got a phone call saying my wife and daughter had just been killed, and my two boys weren't likely to make it.
And there were people who came to me, who surrounded me—and I mean this sincerely—that gave me reason to stay. They saved my sanity. And that's not hyperbole.
A lot of you've been through as much or worse than I've been through. And I'm not—I'm not talking about the death of it. But what people—I didn't want to stay. I had called my sister, who managed my campaign, and my brother and said, ""We elected a Democratic Governor."" Remember, Fred? And we had—already had 58 Democratic Senators. They didn't—it wasn't like they weren't going to have another Democrat replace me.
But a group of Senators, including Fred and about five others, just always were coming by—just come by the office, ""Why don't you just come to lunch with us?"" ""Why don't you""—I wanted no part of it. I wanted to get in and out.
So, Fred, you are not only one of the toughest and smartest Senators I ever worked with, but you have a heart as big as your head, pal. Thank you. Thank you.
And speaking of big, you got yourself a Senator who looks like he could play tight end somewhere around here sitting down at the other end. Just don't jump in the pool right away. Okay? Hang on.
And, look, there's so many people here to thank. If I do that, I'll do the whole night. But I'm going to take a few more minutes to thank just a few more people.
You know, folks, one of the things that—when I said there is—the reasons that I ran, when I announced my running for the Presidency, is that I had no intention of running for President again. My son had—my son Beau had just died because of Iraq. I didn't want any part of getting engaged. I was out of office. I was a full professor at the University of Pennsylvania. They gave me a $2 million staff. I had staff like Tony Blinken doing foreign policy with me and others. And I didn't want to run.
And—but then remember what happened in Charlottesville? When those folks came out of the woods carrying torches, Nazi banners, singing the same anti-Semitic bile they sang in '33 and '34 in Germany, and accompanied by the Ku Klux Klan. And a young woman, whose mother I met, was killed—who was standing by and was killed.
And they asked the sitting President what he thought, and he said there was good people on both sides. That's when I decided—and many of you did, too—that you had—we had to be engaged. This is a different deal. This is a different deal.
This is not about this upcoming election. This is about the past.
And so, we found ourselves—I concluded when I ran—one of the things Fred and I agreed on when we were in the Senate was that, you know, trickle-down economics never worked much for my dad. My dad was a gentleman. His greatest regret he was—he never —he was extremely well read. And he had gone—been accepted to John Hopkins. Couldn't do it. Anyway. To make a long story short, his greatest regret: He never went to college.
But my dad was one of those guys who worked like hell, never complained, and would always come home for dinner and then go back to work. But my dad was one of those guys who—nothing much trickled down on his kitchen table. And he used to say: ""Joey""—for real—""a job is about a lot more than a paycheck. It's about your dignity. It's about respect. It's about being able to look you kid in the eye and say, 'Honey, it's going to be okay.'"" Not asking much. Just being a—a clear shot.
And so the second reason I ran was to begin to rebuild this country and rebuild the middle class. Because when the middle class does well, the poor have a way up and the wealthy continue to do very well.
I'm a capitalist. If you can make a billion dollars, make it. If you can make a million dollars, make it. Just pay your taxes. Just pay your taxes.
And so the third reason—and you may remember I got roundly criticized for saying it—was I said, ""I want to unite the country."" For how can a participatory democracy function without unity, without being able to get along with one another? And the press—and the press is here tonight. The press legitimately was saying: Biden had that reputation when he was a Senator; he was able to bring people together.
And I—we served with guys like Jesse Helms and Strom Thurmond and Jim Eastland. By the way, Jim Eastland once said to me—we were walking back from the Judiciary Committee one day. We were taking pictures a moment ago—all of us. And I came around the corner and there was a group of—well, I was walking with him back to his office from the Judiciary Committee meeting.
And all of a sudden, we turned the corner and there are about 10 people from Mississippi. And they don't ask to have their picture ""taken""; they want their picture ""made."" They said, ""Mr. Chairman! Mr. Chairman! Can I have my picture made with—[inaudible]?"" Next thing you know, I'm in the picture.
And I went into his office with him. And he said, ""Joe, you all know those folks in Mississippi?"" And I said: ""No, I didn't. I'm sorry, Mr. Chairman. I didn't mean to be in the picture."" He said, ""Whenever you have your picture made with folks you don't know, always stand on the end."" He said, ""No body parts touching."" [Laughter] He said, ""Because that way, if they turn out bad, you can cut yourself out."" [Laughter]
Well, a lot of people are getting cut out these days. And it's a different place. Fred, I don't think you'd recognize it. It's a different place. Your two Senators here can tell you that.
And so one of the things that we are trying to do is, I decided that we were just going to go ahead and try to keep the commitments that I made.
And, you know Ben Ray has been a partner of mine for a long time. I don't know how we could get much we got done without Ben.
And your new Representative. She's doing one hell of a job. She's doing one hell of a job.
And Mayor Tim Keller and other elected officials here. Tim is going to be—[applause]—you're announcing—I won't—I'm not going to jump but when are you going to make that announcement you talked to me about today? Is it Friday or——
Mayor Timothy M. Keller of Albuquerque, NM. Friday.
The President. Friday. More good news coming, I believe.
And by the way, you know, I just came from your neighboring State of Arizona. And you're right, they do claim to have the largest Native American population. But I met with 15 Tribal leaders. And I had the opportunity to do something I wanted to do. I was able to dedicate 1 million acres of Tribal land back to the surrounding—[applause]—surrounding the Grand Canyon.
But look, folks, let me I'm going on too long here. Let me talk about what—you know, a lot of you are the reason I got elected in the first place. That's not hyperbole. And I appreciate you taking a shot with me again.
I've never been—I've been—I know I'm only 35 years old. I know that. [Laughter] But I've never been more optimistic about America's chances than I am today. I mean that sincerely. Because we are, I truly believe—and when I was deciding whether or not to run the last time, I started to write a book about the inflection points in history, where every couple of generations, things change in such a profound way that they're never going to go back to being the same. It could be better or worse, but they're fundamental changes.
And that's what's going on now. There's fundamental changes happening, whether it's global warming or the tundra melting and—whatever it is, there's just fundamental change taking place. And we have a chance to move it in the right directions if we're smart about it.
And so far, there's two things that we have to do. Take a look what's happening around the world. We found ourselves in a circumstance where we—Putin is—and it's starting to rain, so I'm going to make this real quick. [Laughter]
The bottom line is: The allegiances are changing around the world in a big way. And they're changing in terms of, for example, the idea that there was going to be a response to Putin's aggression in Ukraine was not likely. I've spent over 200 hours with the heads of state in the European countries, just holding it together—I mean it sincerely—keeping all of NATO and the European Union solidly together so there was no cracks. Because Putin is convinced that if, in fact, he can break NATO, he breaks through, it changes the whole dynamic.
We're in a situation where we fundamentally changed that dynamic in Southeast Asia as well as in the Indian Ocean and the—and that whole area. Because what we have now is, we put together a thing called the Quad. We have—did you ever think you'd have Japan, India, the United States, and Australia working as closely as we are?
Well, guess who wants—I'm going to be going to Vietnam shortly because Vietnam wants to change our relationship and become a partner.
We find ourselves in a situation where all of these changes around the world are taking place at a time we have an opportunity, if we're smart, to change the dynamic.
For example, I'm holding an event at Camp David with South Korea and Japan, together. They've had a rapprochement. So my point is: There's a lot—the country—the world is ready. They're hungry. They know there's a need, and they're looking for leadership.
And one of the things that I'm convinced is true—our former Secretary of State used to say America is the essential nation. We are the essential nation. Not Joe Biden. When I walk into a room, everything changes—not because of Joe Biden, because I'm President of the United States of America. Not a joke.
And so—[applause]—we have an enormous opportunity—enormous opportunity—to change the dynamics in the world, if we're lucky and if we work like hell at it.
On the domestic side, you know, I—I'm going to make this even shorter. We've done, I think, pretty darn well. You know, my dad, as I said, used to say: ""A job is about a lot more than a paycheck. It's about your dignity. It's about pride.""
Well, when we decided to begin to build from the middle out and the bottom up, things began to change.
A few little statistics, which are that—and there's three kinds of lies, as Disraeli said, ""lies, damned lies, and statistics."" But, you know, the—the Economist and the Wall Street Journal, early on, started making fun of Bidenomics. Well, now they're—[inaudible]—praising Bidenomics. They don't know quite what to do with it.
By that, I mean we're building an economy from the middle out and the bottom up. We're establishing our leadership in the world. We're in a position where—this Bidenomics—we've created 13 million jobs in 2 years. That's more than ever has occurred.
We created nearly 800,000 manufacturing jobs—800,000. Unemployment rate is 3.5 percent. It's below that for the longest period in American history.
We're in a situation where inflation is the lowest in 2 years—at 3 percent—when it was 9 percent when we took over.
The point I'm making is that things are beginning to move. But one of the things we did was the American Rescue Plan. Well, you're right about what your Governor did, in terms of saving lives with COVID. We were able to reach out. And when we took office, there were only about 200,000 people who had been vaccinated. We changed that. We changed the entire nation.
Bipartisan infrastructure law: 37,000 projects already approved. And remember with Trump, it was going to be—there's going to be ""Infrastructure Month."" Well, it went on for 4 years. Now we have ""Infrastructure Decade,"" and we're putting a whole hell of a lot of union workers to work with good jobs.
And by the way, I met with the Business Roundtable. They said, ""Why are they calling you the most pro-union President in American history?"" I said, ""Because—[inaudible]."" They said, ""Well, why are you?"" I said, ""Because you need them.""
And—because, you know, everybody thinks you become an electrician, you just show up and say, ""I want to be an electrician""—if you've worked for 4 years as an apprentice to get there.
And so, things are changing. Attitudes are changing between corporate America and labor. Attitudes are changing across the board.
We also decided that my—one of my passions since I've been in—since the eighties was the environment. Well, we've put ourselves in a position where we passed the most comprehensive environmental piece of—it's called the ""Inflation Reduction Act."" It's within that. It has nothing to do with inflation; it has to do with the—[inaudible]—$4- —$600—excuse me, $368 billion, the single largest investment in climate change anywhere in the world—anywhere—no one has ever, ever spent that. And it's beginning to take hold.
I had—I met in the back lawn of the White House—the South Lawn—with all the automobile manufacturers. Guess what? At the time, remember, General Motors was suing California for having a higher standard on pollution, exhaust from tailpipes, than the Federal standard. And they said they couldn't do that.
Well, we had a talk with Mary Barra and others, the chairman of the company, and they changed their mind. They all came to me and said, ""We're going to go totally electric by 2035 and 50-percent electric by '33. That's going to change—[applause]—billions—I mean billions of tons of CO2.
We're in a position where we're changing the nature and way in which we deal with so many other things relating to the environment.
And I just came, as I said, from your neighboring State. There's a lot going on there and all around the world. We're making significant progress.
We're in a situation where we've employed more people than any other nation in the world. We're making other nations—and, by the way, all this—and I'm doing this quickly—and I apologize because I think you're going to get wet.
But—well, here's the deal: You know, they said, ""Well, Biden is a big spender; things are going on—going to be going back""—guess what? When Trump left office, he increased the Federal deficit 235 years by 40 percent. My first 2 years, I've reduced the deficit by 1 trillion 700 billion dollars—[inaudible].
And I made a commitment: No one making less than $400,000 are going to see a penny in Federal taxes going up as long as I'm President of the United States.
But the flip of this is—also—[inaudible], we—you know, we used to have in America—before the pandemic started, we had 749 billionaires. We now have a thousand. You know what the average rate of Federal tax they pay: 8.3 percent. That ain't fair. That ain't fair. I don't want them paying 80 percent. I don't even want—just want them paying the top rate. That's it. It's in the thirties, not the—not the eighties.
And we fundamentally can change the way things was—things work. And I think you're even seeing the business community——
By the way, I know a few things about corporate America. I come from a corporate State of the world. Delaware has more corporations incorporated in the State of Delaware than every other State in the Union combined—combined—every single solitary one.
So my point is: There's so many opportunities, and people are open to the change. They're open to change. And so what we have to do is just keep our head down and keep moving, in my view.
And one of the things we've done—for example, we—I decided to—that—you know, there's a provision in a 1934 law saying that any Federal funds spent by the President of the United States should be made in America and—well as by American personnel. Well, guess what? No President, Democrat or Republican, paid much attention to it. Well, I have.
Well, guess what? That's the reason why we have so much employment going on. We're—we're bringing—for example, we invented the computer chip—it was about the size of the little tip of my finger. And guess what? We used to have 40 percent of the market. We invented it; we made it—we made it work.
Well, guess what? We now have convinced over $450 billion in outside investment building these fabs—these great, big things that are the size of football fields that build these computer chips.
Guess what? The average salary in those fabs is 115,000 bucks. And guess what? You don't need a college degree to be there. You don't need a college degree.
So the other thing we're doing: We're trying to restore pride to the—[inaudible]. Those of you who come from places that are—I'm going to stop. You guys are going to get soaking wet. [Laughter]
Look, I think that we have to understand that people have a—I was born and raised and my family is from Scranton, Pennsylvania. When coal died, everything died, including the pride of the city—the pride of the city. Everybody is from Scranton; no one is in Scranton.
And so, what's happening is all these factories we're going to be building and more construction than any time in modern American history. We're bringing back pride to—and I made a commitment: I represent red States the same way I represent blue States and make no distinction.
And guess what? That factory that your father and your grandfather worked at that employed 2,000 people in town—in a small town in the Midwest—that gave people pride, when—when it shut down, everything shut down. Everything shut down.
How many of you know friends from the Midwest who got—who—their parents were told: ""Mom, Dad, I can't stay. There's no jobs. I've got to leave."" You should be able to stay and work where you live.
And so we're—there are all these factories that are opening up across the country. And they're investing billions of dollars in these factories. Up in Rochester, New York—anyway, it's a significant change—significant change that's underway, if we're conscious of what we're doing and if we're completely, thoroughly honest with the American public about what's going on.
And so, folks, I'm trying to think how to get to the end here real quickly. [Laughter]
The—look, you know, there's two ways to deal with inflation: try to bring it down by the traditional way and what the Fed is doing and what we're doing, et cetera. But, also, there's another way. It's—my dad used to say: ""How much money do you have after you got your monthly paychecks and you've paid all your bills? Do you have any breathing room left? Is there anything left?""
One of the ways to reduce inflation is—anybody you know—I'm not asking you to say yourself, but anybody know anybody with type 1 or type 2 diabetes? You need insulin. Well, guess what? It's between $4- and $800 a month, depending on what you need.
I was in Southern Virginia—I was in Northern Virginia at a town meeting, and a woman stood up. She—and she said: ""I'm a middle-class person. We have insurance but don't have enough insurance to cover my two daughters. Both of them need insulin. And what we do is we cut it in half."" We—well, guess what? You know how much it costs for the drug companies to make that insulin? Ten dollars and twenty cents. To package it: total $13. Charging $4- to $800 makes no sense. And guess what? It's—it's American taxpayers paying for it because the Medicare is paying for this.
So I did—got it—we got a little negotiation. If you are—and God forbid, I hope you don't need it—but if you need insulin, you're paying now fifty —$35 a month to make you—[applause]—because—and, by the way, it's saving the taxpayers billions of dollars—billions of dollars.
And so, for example, beginning in 2024, no matter how many—no matter what your bills are, if you had—and some of the—and some of you, like me, understand the—the ravages of cancer and the cost of the drugs. I don't have cancer, but family members.
And guess what? You know, some of these drugs cost anywhere from $8- to $9,000 a year. Well, beginning in 2024, your total drug cost, if you're on Medicare, will not exceed $2,000, no matter what it is.
And so there is a lot of things we can do to restore some pride and dignity to people. It's all about dignity. It's all about being able to look your kid in the eye. It's all about being able to just hold your head high and say: ""You know, I—I'm doing my best. I have a shot."" And just giving people a shot.
And it's nothing really radical, but it's working. And I think it's going to continue to work.
Folks, you know, we're in a situation where we are now down to—let me conclude by saying it's basically resilience.
You know, when we talk about the environment, we're talking about the things that can fundamentally change how we live. Fundamentally change—one of the hardest things to get through is we're going to spend over 1 trillion 300 billion dollars on the infrastructure over the next 10 years. And we're going to spend a significant amount of money—almost $368 billion on the environment and still be able to pay for it.
But here is the deal: In the process of doing that, we've got to be in a position to be able to show people what we've done. And so, although personal ratings are high, when the economy—we're running—the idea we're running in the midforties doesn't seem too consistent.
The more you read—I'm going say something self-serving sounding, at least. Most Presidential historians are giving me enormous credit for saying I've got more done in 2 years than any President since Roosevelt. But it doesn't—no, no, no. It doesn't show. It takes time for people to realize why that's there.
In communities, for example—I'll end with this. Philadelphia, there was a—on the beltway going through Philadelphia, there was a—on 95 north and south, 40—140,000 cars traveled over this one small bridge in Philadelphia and 40,000 trucks. Well, a guy going underneath the bridge knocked down the pillars, the bridge fell down, everything stopped.
It would have ordinarily taken somewhere between 6 and 9 months. I got it done in 5 days—f-i-v-e days. Because we can. We had the capacity to do it. Not just—[inaudible]—we had the capacity and the will to do it. Labor was all in. Everyone was working together.
But in addition to that, we found ourselves in a situation where the Roosevelt Expressway had to be changed. A hundred and nine people dead because of the—how dangerous that expressway is in the curves. Well, we're going to change it.
And people are starting to say in the Philadelphia market, ""God, Biden did this—Biden's proposal did this?""
Well, they're beginning to realize what we've actually passed is having an impact. And so it's going to take a little while, but I don't care whether it does or not as long as it gets done—as long as it gets done.
We have a lot we can do. We're going to get it done. And as—you know, as my—every time I'd walked out of my Grandfather Finnegan's house, my grandpop up in Scranton was a—he was first-generation Irish American. And he—well, let me put it this way: Irish Catholics weren't at the top of the list in Northeast Pennsylvania in the mines.
Matter of fact, one of the great disappointments was we had an uncle who was—turns out to be mining engineer and four of them worked earlier in the mines. And one was accused when he ran—my great-great-grandfather was only the second Irish Catholic ever elected in the State of Pennsylvania to the State Senate. And—and when he passed away—when he was running, they were accusing him of having been a Molly Maguire.
Do you know what a Molly McGuire was? Molly McGuire was one of those folks who when the—were—when the Irish were so badly mistreated in the mines, they had a group of these—basically Irish thugs called Molly Maguires. What they would do is they'd find the people abusing the workers, kill them, and drop them on their doorstep.
Well, the whole family was so disappointed to find out he wasn't a Molly Maguire. [Laughter]
But all kidding aside, things are changing—change rapidly. And as things fell apart, people still stuck together. But there's much more we have to do.
But every time I'd walk out of my grandpop's house, he'd look at me and he'd yell, ""Joey""—my—and he—by the way, he went to Santa Clara out here—out of California, was an All-American football player in 1906, went back, was a newspaper guy in the business side, had four sons and a daughter—my mom.
And—but every time he'd walk out the door, he'd yell, ""Joey, keep the faith."" And my grandmother would go: ""No, Joey. Spread it.""
Let's go spread the faith. Thank you.

"August 08, 2023","Remarks on Signing a Proclamation Establishing the Baaj Nwaavjo I'tah Kukveni-Ancestral Footprints of the Grand Canyon National Monument Near Tusayan, Arizona","
Thank you, thank you. Please have a seat if you have one. If you don't have one, you can sit down anyway if you want. [Laughter]
Well, thank you very, very much. Maya, thank you for the introduction. When I was your age, to be able to stand up and introduce anybody, let alone a President, I would have frozen. Thank you. You're an impressive young woman. And I'm going to come down to those waterfalls pretty soon.
It's great to be here with Secretary Haaland, our first Native American Cabinet Secretary, and Brenda Mallory, the Chair of our Council of Environmental Quality.
And, Governor Hobbs, congratulations, and you're doing a heck of a job.
And Senator Kyrsten Sinema and Congressman—where is the Congressman? Is he here? There—we've been hanging out since I got here a little bit. Raúl has been a good friend and done a great deal. He's one of the most popular Congressmen in the country, I think. Who have long championed this effort in Congress. And Congressman Greg Stanton has been a leader in—as well.
And thanks to all the State, county, and local officials who've worked so hard to see this day happen, make it happen. And you have. Believe me, I know you have.
To the Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management professionals here, thank you. Thank you for caring for our public lands, the most precious thing we have.
And special thanks to Tribal leaders joining us, whose ancestors stewarded these lands since time immemorial. Got to meet most of you last night. I'm looking forward to saying hello to you again today.
And a special hello to Jimmy McCain. Where are you, Jimmy? I'm going to embarrass you. He didn't know—think he was going to be introduced. Where is—there you are, Jimmy.
Jimmy—Jimmy's dad was a dear friend of mine. We were like two brothers who—we got along together. When we argued, we argued like hell. We really went at it. But he was a man of—he was a great patriot and a man of enormous integrity. And, Jimmy, you're just like your dad: serving your country in Iraq and Afghanistan and continuing to serve as a second lieutenant in the United States Army. Thank you, thank you, thank you, pal.
And I say this with all sincerity—no one ever doubts that I mean what I say; sometimes I say all that I mean though—[laughter]—I think of your dad all the time, about how much he loved this country and how optimistic he was, optimistic about our future. So thank you for being here, pal, and thank you for your continued service.
America's natural wonders are our Nation's heart and soul. That's not hyperbole; that's a fact. They unite us. They inspire us. A birthright we pass down from generation to generation. And that's why from day one I've taken historic steps to conserve our natural treasures for all ages.
My first week as President, I signed an Executive order establishing our country's most ambitious conservation goal ever. I made a commitment that we will protect 30 percent of all our Nation's lands and waters—conserve all—30 percent of all our Nation's lands and waters by 2030. And we're on our way. And we're delivering.
Just my first year in office, we've done more—protected more lands than any—than anyone since the 1960s, John Kennedy's era: 9 million acres in Alaska, in Bristol Bay and the Tongass Forest; 225,000 acres in Minnesota, the Boundary Waters.
We're working to protect 770,000 square miles in the Pacific Ocean southwest of Hawaii: a new maritime sanctuary—a network of islands and reefs almost three times the size of Texas—on track to be among the largest protected ocean area on the entire planet.
We've already restored protections for three national monuments gutted by the last administration, two not so far from here in Utah: the Grand Staircase and Bears Ears.
By the way, I'll never forget: I was standing in Washington, and a little girl walked up. And I could see her daddy say, ""Go up and say something to the President."" She walked up, and she said, ""Mr. President, would you take care of Bears Ears for me?"" And I didn't know what she meant when she said it: ""Would you take care of Bears Ears for me?"" Well, we took care of her, and we gave her the signing pen. [Laughter]
A third of the coast of New England in the Northeast Canyons and Seamounts.
Look, we've designated new national monuments as well: Camp Hale in Colorado, 50,000 acres; Spirit Mountain in Nevada, 500,000 acres; Castner Range in Texas, 6,600 acres; and just last month, honoring Emmett Till and his mother Mamie Till-Mobley in Mississippi and in Illinois. But—[applause]—folks, it's not hyperbole to suggest that there is no national treasure—none—that is grander than the Grand Canyon. The Grand Canyon, one of the Earth's nine wonders—wonders of the world, literally. Think of that. You know, it's amazing. An enduring symbol of America to the entire world.
The first time I saw the Grand Canyon, years ago, I was a young Senator. As I stood there and looked out, a phrase came to mind. It was instinctive. I said this must be—this is God's cathedral. That's what it reminded me of. It just is so magnificent. As a matter of fact—I said nine—it's one of the seven wonders of the world.
And so today I'm proud to use my authority under the Antiquities Act to protect 1—almost 1 million acres of public land around Grand Canyon National Park as a new national monument—[applause]—to help right the wrongs of the past and conserve this land of ancestral footprints for all future generations.
Over the years, hundreds of millions of people have traveled to the Grand Canyon, awed—awed—by its majesty. But fewer are aware of its full history.
From time immemorial, more than a dozen Tribal nations have lived, gathered, prayed on these lands. But some 100 years ago, they were forced out.
That very act of preserving the Grand Canyon as a national park was used to deny Indigenous people full access to their homelands, to the places where they hunted, gathered. Took precious, sacred ancestral sites.
They fought for decades to be able to return to these lands, to protect these lands from mining and development, to clear them of contamination, to preserve their shared legacy for future generations.
I made a commitment as President to prioritize respect for the Tribal sovereignty and self-determination, to honor the solemn promises the United States made to Tribal nations to fulfill Federal trust and treaty obligations. I've pledged to keep using all that available authority to protect sacred Tribal lands. My administration has worked alongside Tribal leaders, including many of you who are here today, to keep that promise.
At a time—at a time when some seek to ban books and bury history, we're making it clear that we can't just choose to learn only what we want to know. We should learn everything that's good, bad, and the truth about who we are as a nation. That's what great nations do, and we are the greatest of all nations.
Only with truth comes healing and justice and another step toward forming a more perfect Union.
Folks, our Nation's history is etched in our people and in our lands. Today's action is going to protect and preserve that history along with these high plateaus and deep canyons, majestic red cliffs over 300 million years old—older than the oldest dinosaur ever known; central to the creation stories of so many Tribal people and so many Tribal nations; fundamental to who we are, to their way of life, to their most sacred ceremonies. Ancestors buried here, eternal sources of reverence and healing.
These lands also support a range of ecosystems and plants, from savannas to sagebrush to ponderosa pine. A haven of hironic [iconic; White House correction] species like bats, bison, bighorn sheep, and nearly 450 kinds of birds, including the bald and golden eagles.
They are the historic home of 3,000 cultural sites—cliff houses, cave paintings—ancient spots that help us understand the history of these civilizations.
They also are key to building resilience to drought and climate change. Creeks and streams flowing into the Colorado River, supporting farms and ranches across the Southwest and bringing clean water to 40 million Americans.
And by creating this monument, we're setting aside new spaces for families to hike, bike, hunt, fish, and camp, growing the tourism economy that already accounts for 11 percent of all Arizona jobs.
Folks, preserving these lands is good not only for Arizona, but for the planet. It's good for the economy. It's good for the soul of the Nation. And I believe with my core—in my core it's the right thing to do.
But there's more work ahead to combat the existential threat of climate change. You know, we've seen historic floods, more intense droughts, wildfires spreading smoky haze, which you could—I could sense today—thousands of miles. Record temperatures affecting more than 100 million Americans this summer. Over a hundred—I need not tell you all—over 110 degrees in Phoenix for 31 straight days.
You know, our extreme heat is America's number-one weather-related killer. Extreme heat kills more people than floods, hurricanes, and tornadoes combined. And it's threatening the farms, the forests, and the fisheries of—so many families depend on to make a living.
But none of this need be inevitable. From the start of my administration, we've taken an unprecedented action to combat climate crisis.
Last year, I signed the largest climate bill in the history not only of the United States, but literally in the history of the world. It's the biggest investment in climate conservation and environmental justice ever, anywhere, in the history of the world.
And it has many parts. For example, it will save working families thousands of dollars a year if they install rooftop solar or weatherize their homes and also conserve energy.
And it includes a record $720 million for Native communities to ease the impact of droughts and rising sea levels, to bring clean electricity to Tribal homes.
In all, these historic measures put us on track to cut all American emissions in half—in half—by 2030, and we're well on our way. It also creates enormous employment, enormous growth in things that better people's lives.
My mom, God love her, had an expression when I lost my family. She said, ""Joey, out of everything bad, something good will come if you look hard enough for it."" Well, there's a lot of good that's going to come from the sacrifices of dealing with taking on the climate crisis.
Folks, these are investments in our planet, our people, in America itself: protecting our outdoor treasures, making our Nation more resilient.
But some MAGA extremists in Congress are trying to undo it all. I didn't get any help from the guys on the other team. Every single, solitary person voted against this historic clean energy investment. And now many of them are trying again to repeal these parts of the bills, but we won't let them. There's too much at stake.
Let me close with this. America's natural wonders are central to our heritage and our identity as a nation. Conserving them not only protects the livelihoods of the people who depend on them, it preserves key pieces of our history, of the full American story, for generations to come. It unites us through all ages and connects us to something bigger than ourselves—much bigger than ourselves.
Today marks an historic step in preserving the majesty of this place. First among American landmarks. Sacred to Tribal Nations. Revered by every American. It speaks to the soul of our Nation. It reminds us of who we are.
And we can't—we are the United States of America. And there is nothing—nothing—beyond our capacity when we act together. Nothing. Nothing at all.
And, folks, God bless you all. May God protects our troops.
Now I want to invite some of our guests on stage—I think they know who they are—who are supposed to come up—as I sign the proclamation establishing the Ancestral Footprints of the Grand Canyon National Monument.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.
[At this point, the President moved to the signing desk.]
I wonder who is going to be the first one to walk the million acres. The Secretary says she's sure many people have done it already.
All right, here we go.
[The President signed the proclamation.]
It's official.

"August 07, 2023",Remarks Honoring the 2022 World Series Champion Houston Astros,"
The President. Thank you, thank you, thank you. Please, have a seat.
Audience member. We love you!
The President. Well, thank you. My name is Joe Biden. I play center field. [Laughter] At least I used to——
Audience member. We love you, Joe! 
The President. At least I used to play center field. [Laughter]
Well, I'll tell you what: If you gave me a choice of standing here or on that riser, I'm not sure which I'd pick. [Laughter]
Welcome, guys. Welcome, welcome, welcome, welcome. And I want to welcome to the White House the 2022 World Series Champions, the Houston Astros.
From team owner Jim Crane to manager Dusty Baker—a name known to many of you—to the players and everyone in the organization, it's great to have you here. It really is great to have you here.
And it's great to see so many of your fans, including the Second Gentleman and Representative Al Green—Randall Weber. Where—where's Al? Is Al here? There you are. I'm making sure I can see you, Al. I—because, I know, if I don't—see, if he doesn't see me, that cane hurts. [Laughter]
Representative Alexander N. Green. We'll be back next year, Mr. President.
The President. And Randall Weber—where is Randall?
Audience member. Right here.
The President. Oh, there you go, Randall. [Inaudible]
Representative Randy K. Weber, Sr. We will be back next year. [Inaudible]
The President. I tell you—and if you want anybody, you want Sheila Jackson Lee on your team because you don't want to be on the opposite side of her.
Representative Shelia Jackson Lee. [Inaudible]
The President. You're playing every minute, I tell you. Look—who has the distinction of representing Minute Maid Park, home of the Astros, by the way.
The Houston Astros: legends of Space City. The legends of Space City. Now, you know, a hundred years from now, they'll wonder what the hell that was: the Space City. [Laughter]
A hundred and six regular season wins, the best American League in the season—the best season in the—of the—in the American League. Twenty-one shutouts of opposing teams, the most in the entire league, including the postseason.
Swept the Mariners, the Yankees in the American League playoffs. And then, although I love these guys, this next part is hard to say—[laughter]—then they beat the Phillies in six games to win the World Series. Now, you all realize that means I can't go back to Philly, you know. [Laughter] Oh, I kid.
Look, led by World Series MVP—where is Jeremy? Jeremy—raise your hand so everybody sees you—Peña. The first rookie position player to earn the honor. First—first, first. Led by five All-Stars, as well as a group of pitchers who pitched the first combined no-hitter in postseason history.
And you guys just weren't satisfied winning the World Series, man, you had to break every record.
I tell you, remarkable achievements led by—and this is not hyperbole—the legendary Dusty Baker. Worst part about it is, I remember rooting for him as a kid, and I was older than he was. [Laughter] Geez.
[At this point, the President made the sign of the cross.]
[Laughter] Dusty, it wasn't easy. People counted you out, saying you were past your prime. Hell, I know something about that. [Laughter] I know something about that. [Laughter]
Dusty, a former marine and a man of faith who has never given up, with a record to prove it. An All-Star player, three-time—three-time—Manager of the Year, the first coach to lead five teams to postseason in all of baseball history, and finally, World Series champion as a player and a manager.
There were plenty of folks rooting for the Astros, but the whole country was rooting for Dusty Baker, I promise you that. The whole country.
Look, and this team didn't just step up on the field, you stepped up for the community. I think I was mentioning this to the guys a little—a few minutes earlier. You focused on issues that are near and dear to my heart—I mean that sincerely—like raising awareness on domestic violence.
You know, I spent a lot of my career writing the Violence Against Women Act. I think the only—my dad used to have an expression that the idea—the idea—that the abuse of power—any man that raised his hand to a woman is just a frigging coward.
And you know, your support for kids with cancer. Me and my family and many families in America, that cuts very personally. And we started up the Biden Cancer Initiative and the Cancer Moonshot. We brought researchers, nonprofits, advocates, patients to end cancer as we know it, including pediatric cancer, which is often not researched.
You know, then, during terrible winter of 2021, you stepped up helping those most in need. And it matters. Don't under estimate it, guys. It's an American thing to do. You showed up for the people of Uvalde when they needed it most. I spent a lot of time in Uvalde, met every single family. I made sure I met every single, solitary family and spent time with them.
And I don't know——
[The President gestured toward the teleprompter.]
You know, I don't know what they're doing with that machine. I mean, they're just rolling along here.
But the point is, the—you know, I think you athletes underestimate how much hope you give. Not a joke. I'm not being—this is not hyperbole. I give you my word.
Every one of those kids—and when you guys decided—the men who decided to roll up and take 300 of these kids and their families to the ballgame, it gave them a little bit of hope.
Well, some of you have suffered loss in your life. You understand it. It's astounding what you do. I really mean it. And it meant a great deal. I—one of the reasons why I like you guys so damn much. You know, the community was devastated. And you guys—my dad used to say, ""Half of winning is showing up."" You showed up.
You spent time with the surviving students. You gave them hope. You played ball in the park with them. You signed jerseys with their names of the children that were lost on it. I mean, it really—it validates in ways I don't think you really understand.
You hosted a ""Uvalde Storm Day""—""Strong Day."" And, as I said, 3,000 Uvalde residents—provided buses to bring them to the game. You guys are the real deal.
And the victim's sister, Faith Mata, whose sister Tess was killed, threw out the ceremonial first pitch. Imagine what it was like for her standing on that mound—or standing near it. Imagine what it was like and what it did. It really matters, I promise you. I promise you.
And this team said to the community that day: ""You're family. You're neighbors. We want to do whatever we can to help you get through this process. And if it's just a smile on a Sunday for our game, that's what we want to do."" That's what you did. You did a whole lot more.
Yes, sports is about winning. But it's a lot more than that. At best, it lifts people up, it brings them together, it helps them be there for each other.
I was honored to host the 2022 Houston Astros—2022 Houston Astros here at the White House.
And by the way, congratulations. [Laughter] I didn't bother—I didn't even say that part yet. [Laughter] But no—I've done a lot of these. You're an impressive group of men. I mean, you really are. From management on down—to ownership. I mean, you care.
And I—this is not part of the program here, guys, but I'll bet you, you were surprised their—it gave you heart to see the reaction that people had to those kids when you took them out on the field. It matters. So thank you, thank you, thank you.
And folks, let me end by saying God bless you all, and may God protect our troops.
Thank you, thank you.
With that, I'm going to bring out the guy—totally unknown to all of you—Jim Crane, to say a few words. [Laughter]
Owner and Chairman James R. Crane. Mr. President, First Lady, on behalf of my family—I've got most of my crew here today—and the entire——
The President. That James?
Mr. Crane. Yes, that's Big James—and the entire Houston organization, thank you for having us at—at this afternoon here. It's a great honor. And we appreciate the hospitality. The staff has been great, very welcoming. And I'd like to thank them.
And today is a special day. It's not only for the player—these great players and coaches work hard every day. But we have a lot of our people. We've got some announcers in here. I parked car with—cars with that guy when I was 16 in St. Louis.
The President. Oh, is that right?
Mr. Crane. We're still parking cars. [Laughter]
And so the whole organization pitches in. I don't think everybody realizes how hard everyone works, from the announcers, guys cleaning the stadium. All those jobs are very important. And it really helped us win 2022. It was a very, very—a team effort from these great players and our entire group here today. And I appreciate everybody coming up today.
We're here representing the city of Houston. We have some politicians over there we know very well. And thank you for the great support.
But we have the best fans in baseball. And we want to thank our fans. Without the fans—I tell everybody the fans pay the bills. [Laughter] They pay the salaries. I'm just a little conduit. [Laughter] And we wouldn't be here without all that support.
The other thing: We were lucky to pick off Dusty a few years ago, and Dusty has an unbelievable career. Everyone knows that. But this year, he won a World Series. He hadn't won a World Series, believe it or not.
The President. Played in one. [Laughter]
Mr. Crane. And I'm happy to turn it over to him. And I'm proud to have Dusty as our manager.
Manager Johnnie B. ""Dusty"" Baker, Jr. Thank you. [Laughter] Well, thanks, Jim. Good afternoon. And we're honored to be here today to represent the city of Houston and this organization.
President Biden, First Lady Dr. Biden, and your team, we thank you for inviting us to this celebration of our championship. These guys deserve it. And we thank you for the hospitality.
These guys standing behind me are the greatest guys that I've been around. They always believed in themselves. They always believed in themselves, prior to me even coming here, that they had the ability to win. And they show what perseverance and character can do for you.
I have these readings every day that I read. And that was about—today was perseverance. And perseverance has been, you know, the biggest part of my life. And perseverance has been the biggest part of these guys' life, or else you can't make it to the promised land like we did.
These guys, you know, were a group of veterans alongside some incredible young men who stepped into big shoes and made big plays for the biggest stage. We all know baseball is a long season, and they came to play every day. That's what we talk about all the time.
They were consistent in their personalities and confidence, and they had each other with unwavering support for each other and love for each other. I mean, I think that is probably one of the biggest things that this team has, compared to other teams that I've been in the past, is that they genuinely loved each other.
And when I asked the late Bill Russell what was the keys to the Celtics, who—whom I didn't like very well, he told me—[laughter]—he told me that they loved each other.
Twenty twenty-two was never about one individual. It was about a group of men coming together to accomplish something very special for this city that supported them. I love them all. You've got to love each and every one of them. And it's only a way to come together in a special feeling that is tough to describe and hard to repeat. But we play on repeating exactly that feeling.
Houston is a great city, with great people and great fans. Hands down, they're the best baseball fans in America, and we couldn't have done it without their support. I said the night we won that if we won one, we'd win two. And so now I've got to keep my word. I like keeping my word. [Laughter]
And we're in the middle of making it happen right now, coming off a great series in New York heading into a big series in Baltimore, probably the biggest series that Baltimore has had in a while, but—[laughter]. Hey, I'm known to be honest, you know. No harm intended.
And you know, thank you, Mr. President and your staff, for having us here today. It's an honor.
And I'm going to throw it back to Jim to present a special gift to Mr. President. Thank you.
[Mr. Crane presented the President with a jersey.]

"July 28, 2023","Remarks on Signing an Executive Order on Manufacturing Promotion Efforts in Auburn, Maine","
Kathie, thank you. Thank you, thank you, thank you.
And to the Governor and the congressional delegation, the mayors, thank you, thank you, thank you.
Governor Janet Mills, you're doing a great job for the people of Maine.
And my good friend and great partner and a tireless fighter for good jobs, Senator Angus King is—including it right here in Auburn Manufacturing.
Representative Cherrel [Chellie; White House correction] Pingree, a champion of farmers and workers, the environment, and a great friend.
And Representative Jared Golden, whose greatest claim to fame is the beautiful wife and little daughter I just met. [Laughter] An independent voice for the people of Maine, you serve the district just like you served your country as a marine, with integrity, honor, and fearlessness. Thank you.
And by the way—[applause]. By the way, he also fought hard for delivering funding on several airports in his district. I wonder how he got that money. [Laughter] You do—you're doing a great job, pal.
And thanks to all the State legislation and local officials here today. And I know you've been hit hard by flooding. And FEMA Administrator Criswell has been working closely with you on—in terms of the ground teams that we have—to get what you need. And we're not going away until everything is back. It's Build Back Better, not just build back to where it was, but better, because the environment has changed an awful lot.
I'm here to talk to you about what we're doing to bring manufacturing back to America, about our progress in building an economy from the middle out and the bottom up, not the top down.
Yesterday we learned the economy grew faster than expected last quarter. And this morning we saw data showing that last month the annual rate of inflation continued to decline. So inflation is now at its lowest point in 2 years.
And wages are up after being adjusted for inflation.
When I came to office, I was determined—determined—to end the trickle-down economy—excuse me, this little stand is out.
[At this point, the President attempted to move the podium riser out of the way with his foot.]
But I'll make sure I don't trip over it. Maybe if I stand on it, I'll make myself 3 inches taller. [Laughter]
I came to office determined—determined—to move from a trickle-down economics that everyone from the Financial Times and the Wall Street Journal and the—has called Bidenomics. But the plan is working: building from the bottom up and the middle out.
Folks, you know, all that trickle-down stuff—when the wealthy do very well, we all do well—well, my dad was an honorable man. My dad worked like the devil. A real gentleman. But not a whole lot ever trickled down on our kitchen table if you're middle class folks. I didn't get much.
According to Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, it's leading to a boom in manufacturing, what we're doing. We've created over 13 million new jobs, more than before the pandemic. Nearly 28,700 here in Maine. Eight hundred thousand new manufacturing jobs nationwide. We've attracted almost a half a billion dollars—half a trillion dollars in outside private investment to grow the economy, because they know it's available now.
That's more jobs in 2 years than have created by any President in a 4-year term.
Unemployment in America has been below 4 percent for the longest stretch in over 50 years. And it's not just that we've recovered all the jobs we lost during the pandemic. It's that we now have more jobs than we did before the pandemic.
And because unemployment has been so low for so long, workers that have been left behind for decades aren't just finding jobs—more jobs, they're finding better jobs with higher pay. And no wonder: Job satisfaction, according to all the measures, is at a 36-year high.
The share of working-age Americans in the workforce is as high as it's been in 20 years, including during every single day my predecessor was President. Remember we had—they were going to have that ""Infrastructure Week""? Anyway, long story. [Laughter]
People are coming off the sidelines. Unemployment is down, but so is inflation. Remember, the experts told me, in total, all—but to get inflation under control—and I love this as a middle class guy—we had to lower wages and had to have higher unemployment—only way to get inflation down. Well, maybe if we get the excess profits of corporate America down, we lower it.
But I've never thought the problem was too many people or that working people were making too much money. We now know a big part of the reason for inflation was the pandemic, the war in Ukraine, broken supply chains, and excess profits, all hitting pocketbooks hard while paddling—while padding corporate profits.
By the way, I'm not against corporations. I come from the corporate capital of the world: Delaware. No, seriously. More corporations are incorporated in my State than every other State in the Union combined. But they should pay their fair share.
When the pandemic hit, all of a sudden, we couldn't get those little computer chips, about the size of the tip of my little finger. Well, guess what? You need about 300 of them to build an automobile. Guess what? And I can go on and on and on. We had tracked it—we had tracked it—over $300 billion and people coming to America to build those factories—those factories now here in America.
I decided we're never going to be in a position we don't—we're not at the beginning of the supply chain—a phrase I don't think any of us really heard until 3 years ago.
So we went to work getting our economy back on track fixing those supply chains. We've made a lot of progress.
Now one reason we have inflation fall by two-thirds without losing jobs is that we're seeing corporate profits start to fall as well. We have more to do, but I like what I said: Inflation is now at the lowest point it's been in over 2 years.
In fact, we have the lowest rate of inflation among the world's major economies. Every major economy in the world, our inflation rate is lower. We're growing faster. We're economically more advanced than every other major country in the world. It's down from 9 percent to 3 percent, and it's going to continue to go down.
While there is more work ahead, earlier this week, the Washington Post suggested Republicans may have to find something else to criticize me for—[laughter]—now that inflation is coming down. Maybe they'll decide to impeach me because it's coming down. I don't know. I love that one. Well, anyway, that's another story. [Laughter]
At the same time, pay for low-wage workers has grown at the fastest pace in over two decades, and wages are growing faster than inflation. That means an awful lot to working people where I come from; they have more money in their pockets than they did before.
My dad used to say, ""At the end of the month, the question is: Do you just have a little—after you pay all your bills, do you have just a little breathing room—a little breathing room, a little left over?"" Folks, that's Bidenomics. It's about growing the economy and strengthening the middle class, making things in America again.
Under trickle-down economics, it didn't matter where companies made things, as long as it helped their bottom line, even if that meant jobs and supply chains moved overseas.
What did most of these guys do? They decided to send the jobs overseas where the labor was cheaper and bring the product made back to the United States more expensive. Entire towns and communities got hollowed out not just here in Maine, but all across America. This is not just for Maine, this is all of America. Small towns and medium-sized towns all across America factories got shut down.
All over the country, parents saying to their children: ""Honey, I'm sorry. I lost my job. We can't live here anymore.""
You saw it here in Maine. Let me remind you of a few examples: Auburn and Lewiston, right next door, used to be home to some of the country's largest textile mills. Bates Manufacturing was the largest employer in Maine with thousands of employees supplying the country with high-quality cloth and quilts.
Bates Manufacturing survived the Civil War, the Great Depression, and two World Wars. But in the 1990s, American textile production moved overseas, and Bates closed shop. And by the way, my State used to be a gigantic producer of textile, the DuPont Company.
The same thing happened with Maine's iconic paper industry—the same thing happened. The industry lost 8,000 jobs over the past two decades as paper mills shut their doors.
Take the Verso mill in Bucks—excuse me, Bucksport. Founded in 1829 [1929; White House correction]. Provided generations of good jobs and up to 40 percent—47 percent of the town's tax revenue. A decade ago, it closed down, devastating the town, like so many thousands of towns all across America.
Between 1990 and 2010, Maine lost nearly 45,000 manufacturing jobs. And like we saw across the country, once-thriving cities and towns became shadows of what they used to be. And when these towns were hollowed out, something else was lost as well. And I come from Northeast Pennsylvania; I know about shutting down towns. Pride—people lost their pride.
Folks, this is what trickle-down economics looks like. But now we're turning things around. Since I took office, we've attracted over half a trillion dollars in private investment in manufacturing in America—industries of the future. We're seeing a factory boom. Spending on construction of manufacturing plants nearly doubled in the last 2 years, after growing only 2 percent under my predecessor in his 4-year term.
The last quarter factory construction contributed to—more to the gross domestic product than it did any time in the last 40 years. Instead of exporting American jobs, we're creating American jobs and exporting American products again. That's how we make money.
Like here at Auburn Manufacturing, now, you heard Kathie talk about starting this company 40 years ago making advanced textiles that are fire and heat resistant. They weathered decades of economic storms. Now, with the help of the American Rescue Plan, they're having their biggest export year ever. The company is growing, and their products are made in America. Made in America.
Not just here, but here we're seeing a resurgence in Maine's paper industry as well. Under the previous administration, a mill in Westbrook owned by Sappi North America laid off 75 workers. Under my administration, they got a million-dollar grant from the American Rescue Plan. They used it to invest in technology to improve pulp yields. Now they're expanding their business, creating hundreds of good-paying jobs.
In Bucksport, the old Verso site is now home of an aquafarming company that raises sustainable salmon. The town is beginning to boom again.
And that's just the beginning. We're focused on growing the rural economy in Maine as well and all across the country. For example, under my administration, Maine has received millions of dollars to strengthen and expand access to small and mid-sized meat and poultry processing. Up to now, you had to go hundreds of miles, and you only had a few processors, and they gave you what they thought was necessary, not what your product was worth.
Having these facilities close by means farmers have a better shot at getting a fair price for their product. When those farmers do well, when the wealth they generate stays in Maine, when their children can stay in Maine and continue to farm, it builds a strong rural economy.
Building an economy from the bottom up and the middle out means small and mid-sized farmers, foresters, fishermen have a chance to succeed right here where they're from and don't want to leave.
That's why we're providing funding to encourage companies to use resources harvested in Maine for new and innovative products. And we're creating new markets for those products, like mass timber for the use in tall buildings or plant-based packaging materials or sustainable aviation fuels. That's where it's going to come from, by the way. Mark my words, the next 20 years, farmers are going to be providing 95 percent of all the sustainable airline fuel. From product.
We're helping fund renovations at the library of Bar Harbor or Portland Museum of Art using locally sourced mass timber.
We have a grant to a company called Tanbark in Saco to replace plastic packaging with packaging using wood fiber. And so your kids turn on—how many of your kids come to you and say, ""Mommy, I didn't realize all that plastic was killing all those things in the ocean."" Those ads you see. But because of what's going to happen here, that's not going to happen.
Bio-based products are the future of Maine, and Maine is leading the way.
Just last week, the National Climate Adviser was in Madison for the opening of TimberHP, a brandnew company that's turned a shuttered paper mill into America's first wood fiber insulation factory produced with 100-percent clean energy, helping families save on energy bills and creating 140 new jobs.
And I want to congratulate Governor Mills, who just yesterday signed legislation making Maine a leader in offshore wind industry. It's a big deal. It is a big, big deal. Committing—and the Federal Government is doing the same—committing to 3 gigawatts of offshore wind by 2040 and which will create good-paying union jobs.
I remember the Business Roundtable—the big businessmen, they said, ""Why are you known as the most prolabor Senator in the history of America?"" A simple reason: It makes sure the product is better and ultimately cheaper.
You know, everybody thinks that to become a—for example, an electrician. You show up and say, ""I want to be an electrician."" You've got 5 years—5 years you've got to work before you can get a full salary and have the right to able to go out there as an electrician. It's like going back to college. Five years. They're the best in the world.
This kind of resurgence is part of my plan to invest in America so our future, again, is made in America.
Most people don't know there has been a law on the books since 1933, which means it's totally consistent with all trade laws that exist in the world. And that law says that when the Federal Government spends your tax dollars, it must be spent on American workers and products made in America.
So, for example, when the Congress comes along and says, we want to build new decks for aircraft carriers—for example, over the last so many years, I get $60 billion they vote to do things federally. Well, guess what? They ain't doing any of it unless they build it in America, by American workers. Because for the last 50 years, the vast majority of Democrats and Republicans did not insist on that—did not—and that's what I mean by ""Made in America.""
Well, guess what? I'm insisting on it. That's why it's here. And by the way, it's good for everybody. It's not just good for labor, it's good for everybody.
And today I'm going to sign an Executive order called ""Invent It Here, and Make It Here."" It's—here's how it works: Federal agencies research and fund development to encourage innovation. This Executive order dictates that those agencies have to prioritize domestic manufacturing when it comes time to bring those inventions to market. They can't go abroad. They have to look here—who can do it here. That's the law, and we're just beginning to enforce it.
Folks, we're not just making things in America. We're also buying American.
I announced new standards to require construction materials used in Federal infrastructure projects to be made in America: lumber, glass, drywall, fiber optic cables, and more. Every Federal infrastructure project will be built by American workers using American products, creating American jobs.
Folks, you know, these international agencies rate all governments about their capacities. We used to be rated—have the number-one best infrastructure in the world. Now we're number 13. China used to be beyond 13, and now they're number 2 or 3. What's going on here?
How can you have the most—the best economy in the world and the 13th-ranked infrastructure in the world?
Through the bipartisan infrastructure law—some of my Republicans crossed over and supported this—we've already announced over 37,000 projects in 4,500 communities. Remember we used to have ""Infrastructure Week"" in the last guy's administration? Now we've got Infrastructure Decade. Because guess what? Guess what? It's 1 trillion 300 billion dollars invested in America over the next 10 years, $1.5 billion invested right here in Maine so far.
For example, we're cleaning up legacy pollution: Callahan Mine in the Superfund site in Brooksville. Maine is receiving $164 million to replace lead service lines and improve drinking water and address contaminants like PFAS. We're removing every single lead pipe in America. They're a risk to everyone's health, especially to our children, with—400,000 school fountains have that lead in them.
Right now over 42,000 homes and small businesses across Maine don't have access to high-speed internet. We're investing $500 million in Maine to connect every single corner of the State, especially in rural communities, to the internet—affordable internet. And we're making it affordable, saving nearly 100,000 families $30 a month for their internet bills.
We're making investments like this all across the country. You can see exactly where to go, if you go to—online to go to invest.com—invest.com. Punch in wherever neighborhood you want to find out about, and you'll see what we're doing.
These investments are going to create thousands of jobs across the country. We're making sure workers have the skills they need to do these jobs
In Maine, the AFL-CIO is—with funding from the American Rescue Plan—just graduated its first cohort of its Union Construction Academy to bring unprecedented workers, like women and people of color, into the trades.
The IBEW—[applause.] The IBEW, also with funding from the American Rescue Plan, runs a pre-apprenticeship program for high school students, and there is a training center in Newport.
Folks, this matters.
My ""Investing in America"" agenda also has another transformative impact. Every single Republican in the Congress voted against the Inflation Reduction Act. That's the one that had a total of $659 billion in it for infrastructure—I mean for the environment over the next several years.
You see, they don't think we have an environmental crisis. All this stuff happening is just temporary. They don't wonder about it anymore. You know, when the ocean off the State of Delaware—or off of Florida is 102 degrees, something is going on.
The vast majority of them voted against the infrastructure law as well. But that hasn't stopped them from claiming credit for it now that billions of dollars and thousands of jobs are coming into their States. Well, like I said at the State of the Union: I'll see them at the ground breaking. [Laughter]
Folks, the distinguished Senator from Alabama put out a release saying Alabama is so—I forget the exact number—is going to get 1 billion 600 million dollars for such and such. He voted against it. He voted against it. I could go on, but I won't. [Laughter]
But I made a commitment when I ran that I'd be President for everybody, whether they voted for me or against me. The vast—a majority of all this money is going into red States because they've been so badly hurt. A majority of it. I'm not picking winners and losers based on who they voted for. I'm picking winners and losers based on the need they have in their communities.
Folks, let me close with this. I'm not here to declare victory on the economy. We have more work to do. We have a plan for turning things around.
Bidenomics is just another way of saying restoring the American Dream. Forty years of trickle-down economics limited that dream to the very top.
But I believe every American willing to work should be able to get a job, no matter where they live—in the Heartland, small towns, the Northeast, big cities—to raise their kids on a good paycheck and keep their roots where they grew up.
My dad used to have a saying. My dad was a well-read man whose greatest regret was he never got to go to college, but a really decent, honorable man. And he used to—and I give you my word, this is what he'd say—and all my siblings remember and my friends. He'd say: ""Joey, a job is about a lot more than a paycheck. It's about your dignity. It's about respect. It's about being able to look your kid in the eye and say, 'Honey, it's going to be okay. It's going to be okay.'""
That's what it's all about. That's what it's about. That's the American Dream. If you're willing to work hard, you ought to be able to make it. It shouldn't be limited to just a few people. It's rooted in what's always worked best in this country: investing in America, investing in Americans. Because when we invest in our people and we strengthen the middle class, we see stronger economic growth, and everybody benefits.
You know, we're making significant progress, and I want you to know we've done all this without raising taxes. And guess what? I commit that we'll never raise Federal tax on anybody making less than $400,000. Period.
Unlike—and you hear some of my friends on the other side, the MAGA Republicans, saying Big Spendin' Biden is raising the deficit. Guess what? In the 4 years that the last guy was President, he raised the national debt by almost 40 percent. You know that $2 trillion tax cut? Raise your hand if you got any of it. Two trillion, not a penny paid for.
But guess what? In 2 years, I've cut the national debt by 1 trillion 700 billion dollars while doing all of this—while doing all this—[applause]—1 trillion 700 billion dollars.
Because when ordinary people are able to make a living, they buy things, they go out and do things, they're able to live. And it raises funding. It doesn't cut it. It doesn't cut—the idea that we're going to have a bigger debt.
For the longest time, I've been told to give up on American manufacturing. And some of you have been involved in American manufacturing—how many times have you been told, ""Well, we used to be the largest manufacturer in the world, but not anymore. We can't compete."" Hell we can't compete.
There is nobody in the world we can't beat, let alone compete. I've never believed it. And we have the tools to change it. America used to lead the world in manufacturing, and we're doing it again.
Folks, I'm honestly—I can honestly say I've never been more optimistic about America's future. Now, I know I look like I've only been around a couple of days, but—[laughter]—I've been around a long time.
I've said—and I've said to—and all my colleagues, and I think my former colleague in the Senate used to hear me say it: It's never, ever been a good bet to bet against the American people. Never, never, never. And it's a real bad bet to bet against us now.
So, folks, I really mean this: We just have to remember who in God's name we are. We are the United States of America. And there has never been a single thing—a single thing—we've set our mind to in war or peace, when we've done it together, we haven't accomplished. Not one thing.
That's who we are. Let's not forget that. There is nothing beyond our capacity if we work together like you're doing here in Maine.
So God bless you all, and may God protect our troops. Thank you very much.
[The President left the podium and greeted members of the audience. He then returned to the signing desk and continued his remarks as follows.]
And the bad news is, I'm coming back to shake your hand, but I forgot I didn't sign the order. [Laughter] All that talk and no action.
All right. I'm signing the Executive order. Federal research and development in support of domestic manufacturing in the United States, which means more jobs.
[The President signed the Executive order titled ""Federal Research and Development in Support of Domestic Manufacturing and United States Jobs.""]

"July 28, 2023","Remarks at a Campaign Reception in Freeport, Maine","
The President. Thank you very much. Let me begin with three comments. One, this is a busman's holiday for my colleagues I serve with. Thank you for being here. The worst thing to have to do is come in here another—pick your same party you agree with—your own party and hear somebody. Thank you very much. It's above and beyond the call.
And secondly, to all the kids here, I want to make clear: If nothing happens—after this is over, if you all come up, I'm going to give you some money to make your mom and dad to take you to Dairy Queen. [Laughter] Okay? All right? Okay. You all think I'm kidding; I'm not. Can you imagine when you were 10 years old—""We're going to go spend the afternoon—we're going to get dressed to—come on, honey."" Anyway, thank you, thank you, thank you. Only thing that could be worse: You could—your mom or dad could be a President, then you would have to show up at all this stuff. [Laughter]
And the third thing I'd like to say is that—you know, one of the reasons I'm still—it may—it may hurt his reputation, but all kidding aside, one of the reasons why I am still in politics was because of a Maine guy named Ed Muskie. Not a joke.
Ed Muskie and Teddy Kennedy and the guy from South Carolina who was the United States Senator—because I had just been elected to the Senate. I was 29 years old. I wasn't old enough to be sworn in. I had to wait until I could be sworn in. But I had to start to hire staff.
So I was down in Washington using Teddy Kennedy's Whip office so I could interview people. And I got a phone call saying my wife and daughter had just been killed. And so I decided—my brother, who's 5 years younger, was my finance chair. And by the way, I was listed, for 36 years, the poorest man in Congress. So he needed a lot of help. [Laughter]
But. all kidding aside, we were—I wanted him to talk to the Democratic Governor who had just been elected so he would appoint someone—because I'm the first moderate-to-liberal member from the Democratic Party.
Our State is—was a border State. We were segregated by law. We were a slave State. And all the vestiges left over are still there. And so I was the first ""progressive""—quote, unquote—today we would say. But back in those days, I was considered, compared to the Democratic Party—the Democratic Governor had an opportunity, Gov, to decide whether he or she wanted to be member of the Northeast Democratic Coalition—Governors' Conference or the Southern Governors'. And most Governors picked to be part of the Southern Governors' Conference.
And so two-thirds of the State, as Angus knows, in the Delmarva Peninsula talk at 'cha like this, a lot of good ol' boys. [Laughter] No, I'm serious.
And so I asked my brother if he would talk to the Governor and pick someone in my place. And my sister is my best friend and managed all my campaigns. She's 3 years younger. We are 2 years apart in school. She graduated; I graduated from the same university, 2 years apart. She graduated Phi Beta Kappa; I graduated. [Laughter] She—no, I'm not joking. She managed all the—my campaigns.
My point is this: That these men probably saved my sanity by convincing me to stay. What the argument was: Just come and stay—just come and stay for 6 months. Help us organize. We had 58 Democratic Senators. They didn't need anybody to organize. We had whoever—it could be a Democratic Senator—[inaudible]—at my place.
But Ed Muskie went out of his way for me—all the little things. One of the most important men in the Congress, who should have been President—one of the most important men in the Congress. He would just spend time with me.
He would come by my office, and I—for example, I wouldn't go to—I didn't go over and meet and eat with the Senators in the dining room. I would just stay—I didn't want to—I just wanted to get—just not get engaged. And he just went out of his way.
And I look back on it. And you probably help people like that, like I was, many times yourselves, but it mattered. It mattered. My two boys survived. My family—I had great help with my family, my extended family.
But Ed Muskie was a man of enormous, enormous, enormous character. And he had a guy named Hathaway with him that I came along—we came along together and became close friends.
I've always thought of Maine as—it's going to sound bizarre to say this, but as a virtuous place. I'm not joking. It was a place that everybody seemed to have sort of just basic—they disagreed. Like a young woman—I was just—did an event—a speaking event in Maine. And I was talking about the economy. And afterwards, I'm going out, shaking hands with people. And a lovely young woman—looked to be—she was in her early thirties—was a State rep. She had her pin on. And I said, ""Well, you guys passed the legislation for""—yes, for——
Audience member. Family leave.
The President. Family leave, thank you. For family leave. And she said, ""Oh, I voted against it."" [Laughter] And she said, ""I'm a Republican, but I like you."" [Laughter]
But my point is this: We used to talk to one another. We used to get along with one another. There used to be a civility—what we—and in the last—the last 10 years, things have begun to change.
You may remember, I made a speech—because it got a lot of publicity, not all positive. I made a speech at Independence Hall before the 2022 elections—6 days out—where I said our democracy is at stake. Literally, not figuratively. And they thought it was an exaggeration. But guess what? Sixty-six percent of the American people thought that the case: Democracy is at stake.
And so my—the reason I'm so happy to be here with your representatives: They're all decent, honorable people. We can argue like hell. We disagree, although I don't want to get them in trouble. We don't disagree very often. [Laughter] But, anyway—so I think of Maine like I used to think of my State, where everybody knows everybody. And you know, there's an old joke: You know, be careful what you say, they may be related. [Laughter]
So, at any rate, I want to thank you for allowing me to come back to Maine, which I've been here many times, but not since I've been President. Number one.
Number two, I think we're at a place where we're at a genuine inflection point in history. I had a physics professor who said that an inflection point is the time you're going down the highway 60 miles an hour and you make an abrupt, 45-degree or 30-degree turn to the right. You can never get back on the path you were on before. It occurs every five, six, seven generations in world history.
But the world is changing—changing not because Joe Biden is President or Putin is leading Russia. It's because everything's changing from global warming. I last was with Putin two Christmases ago, and I pointed out: He has eight time zones, and the entire tundra is melting. Methane is leaking. It's never going to freeze again.
We've got a fundamental change we've got to deal with. We're seeing changes not just to the climate, but across the world in fundamental ways. And so we'd better get going on what we're going to do about it, both in foreign policy and domestic policy.
But before I decided to announce for the Senate, and I wasn't going to run—I mean for the Presidency, the last time out. And, I think Angus knows: I wasn't going to run again. I had just lost my son. He died because of being—sleeping next to a burn pit for a year and—in Baghdad. And he was a decorated soldier. He—Conspicuous Service medal, the Bronze Star, attorney general of the State of Delaware. Presumptuous of me to say this: He should be the one talking to you today, not me. He was quite—he was attorney general of the State.
My point is that, you know, there's a lot going on. Name me a part of the world that you think is going to look like it did 10 years ago 10 years from now—not a joke. But it presents enormous opportunities—enormous opportunities. I'm just going to go through a few for you, if you will be willing to stick with me on this.
First of all, you know, on the economic front, we have made some real progress in the first 2 years. We've—over 13.2 million new jobs, beyond when we went into the pandemic. We've—inflation is down from 9 percent to 3 percent. We're in a situation where we have a circumstance that we've created 810,000 manufacturing jobs. And how many of you were told manufacturing is dead? You watched it happen here in Maine in the small towns, like in Delaware, in the Midwest, and Nevada—I mean, Nebraska, all—all red, blue States.
A factory that mom and dad worked at for 30 years and made a decent salary—all of a sudden, one day, it up and goes abroad. Because why? We started a process that we had—we took the—the whole notion of trickle-down economics to an extreme. We shipped our—we found the cheapest labor in the world we could find and we shipped the factories over there. And then we brought the product back here, and we sold it here. And America found itself in trouble.
Well, I decided that the way to change—to deal with a changed world here was not that we couldn't compete anymore, it's because we had the wrong philosophy about how to compete. I insisted that—and I—and I've been doing this—I know I don't look it, but I've been doing this a long time. [Laughter]
And one of the things that we—I decided we should build—and I've thought—had this view for a long time: That we should build the economy from the middle out and the bottom up. When that occurs, everybody does well. The wealthy do very well.
I'm a capitalist. I come from the corporate State of the world. More businesses—and some of you know because you may be incorporated—they're incorporated in Delaware—than every other State in the Union combined. Every State. And I represented, as Senator, for 36 years, so I'm not antibusiness. But everybody has got to pay their fair share. Everybody has got to pay their fair share.
We went from having 746 billionaires in America before the pandemic to a thousand. And guess what their average Federal tax is: 8.3 percent. How can that be right? How can that be fair? And so I started to focus on: What do we do to bring this back?
We used to be—have the number-one infrastructure in the world. We're ranked number 14. The United States of America, by—the international folks say that we—we're the 14th best infrastructure: roads, bridges, and the like.
China used to be, I think, 17 or 16. Now number two. What's the matter? Something is wrong. How can we lead the world being 14th in the world on our infrastructure? I'm not joking. Think about it in practical terms, just pure practical terms.
Secondly, manufacturing. You saw what's happened here in Maine. The same thing has happened in Nebraska. You don't have to be in the Northeast. It's the same thing all across the country. How many times have you heard people say they've had their son or daughter has graduated from high school here and then went to college and came back to say: ""Mom, I can't stay. There's no jobs for me here. There's nothing here for me.""
You lost employment like a lot of places lost it. And it's not just manufacturing. How do we get—and by the way, we invented the computer chip. We—it's tinier than the little, tiny end of my finger here. And guess what? We used to have 40 percent of the market. We've got 5 percent.
And you all saw what happened when we got in real trouble in inflation, when you couldn't build automobiles and shutting down plants. It takes so many computer chips to be able to do it.
So I got my colleagues and leadership of this man sitting in the front here of the—dealing with the—the legislation that had to do with providing for investment in technology. And it was called the CHIPS Act. And guess what? It's attracted off the sidelines almost a trillion dollars in private equity investment—almost a trillion.
No, I'm—this is not rocket science. For example, we used to not be able to produce the chips. Well, guess what? We have over $300 billion of commitments to build new chip factories in the United States of America.
And guess what that does? Not only is all the—the construction work and providing union labor to people to get a decent wage, changing their ability—my dad used to say, ""Joey, at the end of the""—no, I'm not joking—my dad was a very refined guy who was very well-read, never had a chance for a college education.
And we—he'd come home and close the business he was running—he didn't own it; he was a manager—he'd come home for dinner and then go back and close it. My dad used to say, ""Joey, the measure is whether at the end of the month you're able to pay all your bills and you have a little breathing room—just a little breathing room."" So many Americans have no breathing room. No breathing room.
And so what do we do? When I went to South Korea and convinced the chip factory to invest in America, and they're investing $100 billion. I said, ""Why are you doing it?"" They said, ""Simple: You're the safest place in the world to invest, number one. And number two, you have the best workers in the world."" Not a joke. I'm not making this up. This is real.
Look what's happening: everything from Poughkeepsie, New York, to just outside of Columbus, Ohio, where Intel has just investing $20 billion building two—what they call ""fabs""—factories. You know what happens when those fabs—they employ thousands of people. And guess what? The average salary is going to be $131,000, and you don't need a college degree to do it.
I was making the case to the Business Roundtable, you know, the biggest corporations in America. They're good people, decent people. And they were asking me why was investing so much money in organized labor and convincing—and—in labor? I said, ""Because you need them."" And they said, ""Well, what we need""—and I said: ""We did a survey when I was Vice President. And we—we met with 342 of the Fortune 500 companies, either on Zoom or in person. I said, 'What do you need most?' They said, 'We need a better educated public.' I said, ""What the heck are you doing about it? Why you oppose my dealing with investing more money in preschool?""
Not—on third grade—3 years old, going to school—not daycare, school. All the studies show—the Harvard, Stanford studies shows it increased by 57 percent, no matter what the background the child comes from, their ability to get through 12 years of school or not. What's the problem?
And by the way, they're beginning to help. It's self-interest.
But my generic point is simple: That there's so much available to us as a country—so much available to us. We've just got to remember who in the Lord's name we are.
We're in a situation where if you take a look at what we've done around the world—you know, you take a look at—does anybody think that the postwar eras still exist, the rules of the road from the end of World War II?
I'm being deadly earnest. It's not hyperbole, just direct statement. It doesn't.
I spent my whole life—the reason I turned down being able to run for Governor, which is a very important job, when I was young man is I wanted to be involved in a foreign policy. I spent most of my life as the chairman of Foreign Relations Committee or doing foreign policy for Barack or now. It's kind of fascinating to take a look at what's going on.
We look at—does anybody think that Europe was likely to hold together if we hadn't pulled it together? Not a joke, not a joke.
I spent over 180 hours with heads of state from the G-7 and the European Union, just holding it together. NATO is stronger today than it's ever been in its existence—not just because of me, but it's stronger today.
And look what's happening with regard to China in the Indian Ocean and in the—you know, I got asked by Xi why I call myself a Pacific nation. I said: ""Because we are. We have a longer border on the Pacific than you do. We are a Pacific nation."" And I said, ""And you wouldn't have been able to move at all unless we were providing you the stability you needed."" Give you my word, he looked at me and said: ""You're right. You're right.""
Look what's happening. Does anybody ever think Japan would increase its military budget over its domestic budget and help a European war on the side of the West? That's what it's doing. It's changing the dynamic significantly.
I'm hosting little—[inaudible]—at Camp David next week. I'm bringing along the leaders of Japan and South Korea. They made a rapprochement from World War II: fundamental change.
Look what's happening in—in Southeast Asia, where now I put together the Quad—meaning India, Japan, Australia, and the United States. Xi said: ""Why are you doing that? You're trying to surround me."" I said: ""No, that's not the reason. I just want to make sure the rules of the road aren't changing.""
International airspace is international airspace. International water space is water space. You can't tell us we can't. Well, where we're going to put up an air identification zone, meaning you can't fly through certain areas, even though it's international airspace. And guess what we did? We flew a B-1 bomber through. Not a joke. Not a joke. Because we can't let this change that's taking place.
I've gotten a call from the head of Vietnam, desperately wants to meet me when I go to the G-20. He wants to elevate us to a major partner, along with Russia and China. What do you think that's about? No, I'm not joking.
I'm not going to take you around the world, but the point is, the world is changing. The world is changing in a big way. And we want to promote democracies—democracies.
Watch what's happened in the Middle East. I got criticized from going to Saudi Arabia, remember? Well, guess what? I got them to prevent overflights for Israel. So they—there's a rapprochement may be underway.
My generic point is, there is so much going on that we can make the world for this young man who's going to be President someday, we can make it a lot safer and better and more secure. We know who's on first, who's on second, and so on.
So, if you think about what's happening—and I was going to make a more detailed speech, but it's—I'm keeping you too long already—the—if you think about what's happening, there is a confluence, if we get this right, of both domestic economic policy and foreign policy. I can make a safer and more secure than we've been a long, long time.
And that's what I'm about. That's what I want to do. I want to get to the point where we're in a situation where we know—look, I said earlier today that I've never been more optimistic about America's future than I am today. I mean it. That's not hyperbole. I've been saying it for a year.
The reason is: Think of anything America's ever set its mind to that we haven't been able to do. Name me—they asked me, ""If you could do one thing, what would you do?"" I said, ""I'd cure cancer."" They said, ""Why?"" It's because it's the one thing people think we can't do.
To demonstrate: This is the United States of America, damn it. When we've worked together, there is no major problem we've been unable to solve. None. And today, we are splintered in a way we never have been.
I'll conclude by telling you a little story. You know, I didn't—even though I sat for 8 years in the Vice President's chair, every morning at 9 o'clock with Barack starting the day off for 8 years, I didn't realize that there was a circumstance where on Inauguration Day, the outgoing President has to be out of the office by 10 o'clock. The incoming President can't come in until 3 o'clock.
So I asked my—because they set aside the furniture, what desk, what rugs, what—whatever you want—and so I asked my brother Jimmy to take care of it for me. And he called the Presidential historian named Jon Meacham, a well-known guy, in to help him because there are certain things that matter: What bust did I want there?
Sit at my desk, and there is only two political leaders I ever had: One was Dr. King and the other was Bobby Kennedy. I had great respect for John Kennedy, but I could never picture him at my kitchen table. I can theoretically think of Bobby Kennedy there. And César Chávez—whose granddaughter is running in my campaign, by the way—who almost cost me an election in 1972.
By the way, because I was sympathetic to the farmworkers, and Southern Delaware, where you've got a $4 billion industry on chickens, they ain't happy about that. [Laughter]
And so, all kidding aside, that—and then, you know, there is a woman who wouldn't move to the back of the bus and changed the whole world. And Harry Truman. I also have Ben Franklin, because I was a Ben Franklin professor of law—international law at Penn for 4 years, and it was a requirement.
But here's the deal: I think I walked into that office and, for years—and I was in there a lot because of—I was chairman of Judiciary or Vice President for a long—I mean—or excuse me—or the chairman of Foreign Relations for a long time. And I walked in, and the only portrait above the fireplace was one of George Washington. Only one all the time I've been there, and I've been there 600 years. [Laughter]
And I walk in—they had the rug that I wanted. We changed the rug and the desk, the Resolute Desk, and my brother picked out the furniture, the couches, and the like. And obviously, Trump wasn't there. He's the first President in the history of the United States of America that didn't show up on Inauguration Day. Classy guy. [Laughter] I was just as happy he didn't.
But my point was that I looked up and I saw this—there is this big portrait four times—three times as big as the Washington portrait—of Franklin Roosevelt. And I said, ""I'm an admirer, but why Franklin Roosevelt?""
And Meacham spoke up, and he said, ""Because no President has taken on the job of President with a world at greater financial disarray than he was."" I said: ""Oh, that's good. I'm really happy about that."" [Laughter] I'm serious.
And I said, ""Why""—and then there were four smaller portraits. One of Washington—the original one was up on the right-hand corner. I mean, if you're looking from my desk, on the left-hand corner. And below it was Abraham Lincoln. I said, ""Why Lincoln?"" He said, ""The Nation has never been as divided since the Civil War.""
Well, folks, you know, I'm not sure how far off they are. But I am sure—I am sure—we cannot succeed as a country unless we change it. No, no think about it.
I—you may remember when I ran the first time, I said I'm running for three reasons. I think my campaign disagreed with my saying it, but I meant it.
One, I wanted to restore the soul of America. We start to treat each other with decency and honor and deal with people in a way that that is more like who we are. Not a joke.
The second thing was I said I want to build the economy from the middle out and the bottom up.
And I said the third thing is, you've got to unite America. Well, your great Senator, George Mitchell, is a close friend of mine I just spoke to. He was the guy, when I left, said Biden did more to be able to bring Republicans and Democrats together than anybody when he was here. An exaggeration on his part, but it was very nice of him to say.
But guess what? Who do you deal with now? How do you get certain things done? Ask Angus what it's like getting things done in the Senate or the House.
But we have to do that. How can you be a participatory democracy without there being the ability to bring people together? How does that happen?
And the last generic point I'll make to you is that, you know, having spent most of my time as Vice President doing foreign policy for Barack and having spent my career focusing mostly on foreign policy for the 36 years I was a Senator, I thought I—I thought I knew the consequence of an American President. But it's amazing.
Madeleine Albright wrote a book. And she referred to America as ""the essential nation."" We literally are. Ask yourself a rhetorical question: Who could possibly bring the world together? Not a joke. Not me. But the President of the United States of America. Who could do it unless the President of the United States does it? Who? What nation could do it?
And so, folks, there's a lot at stake—a whole lot at stake. And I think we have an opportunity. And one of the ways we make life better for us is make life better for the rest of the world. That's why I pushed so hard for the Build Back Better initiative to build the infrastructure in Africa and in Latin America and South America.
We're the ones who polluted the world. We clear cut everything. We made a lot of money. Lula from Brazil wants to meet with me shortly because, you know, there's more carbon absorbed from the air in the Amazon than all the carbon emitted in the—from the United States of America on a yearly basis.
But guess what? They—they're having trouble. They want their farmers to be able to go out and clear the land and make money and so on.
So there's a lot that's out there that we have a chance to do. And, again, there's nothing you can name for me that if America set its mind to do it, we have not been able to do it over time. Nothing. Nothing.
And the whole world is changing. But if we grab hold, we apply the ingenuity and our—you know, our greatest strength—I said when I got elected I was going to have an administration that looked like America. Well, guess what it is? I have a higher percentage of women on my Cabinet than any President ever had—more than the number of men.
In the military, for the first time ever, we're having the Chief of Naval Operations is a woman. Two other four-stars—[inaudible]. So it's changing.
I've appointed more appellate court judges to the Federal courts than—who are African American than every other President in America combined.
And by the way, not for political reasons. For a simple reason: Our strength is our diversity. Our strength is our diversity. It's about time we begin to use it and understand it, deal with it.
So, folks, look, imagine—and by the way, all the stuff we did in the economy, all these programs that we've put forward—in the process, I cut the Federal debt by $1.7 trillion in 2 years. More than any other President of the United States has come close. The last President increased it by $4 trillion.
Folks, there's nothing we can't do if we remember who in God's name are—this is the United States of America. There's nothing beyond our capacity.
And if you think all—you think I was exaggerating about we're at an inflection point? Just take a look at AI. Artificial intelligence. Hang on, baby. It has enormous promise, but enormous possibilities to go wrong. We've got to know what we're doing.
And so, folks, look, the—you know, imagine what we can do if we finish the job. Like I said, I don't think—I think that ordinary people should have an opportunity to get a good education, ordinary people should be able to afford to go to college. I love it when I get criticized for forgiving debt for people whose income is not above $60,000 for college.
Well, guess what? We had the PPP program. If you ran a diner, you had five employees, and, during the pandemic, you got in trouble, guess what? You get—by the way, the woman who criticized me most? She got $220,000 back from that program. I'm not opposed the program, but give me a break. Give me a break.
So, look, you know, I believe this country is about to take off. And you're saying, ""When the hell is he going take off?"" [Laughter] But the investments we've made in the past 2½ years have powered the transformation of this country in the next 50 years and, you know, doing something right now no one thought possible.
But most of them opposed everything that we did, everything we supported. But if you notice, all of a sudden, it's all—they're—there's an inside joke. I say I'm showing up at the spade turning.
Guess what? You have the gentlewoman—talk about an oxymoron—from North Georgia, who is about to get one of the biggest environmental investments of billions of dollars in her district. And she's against it. Guess what? But she's talking about the clarion call.
You're going to get billions of dollars for making sure that everyone in this State has a connection to the internet and affordable.
Well—and the Senator from Alabama, he knew how to coach Alabama, I think. Well, he sure as hell doesn't know what he's talking about now.
He just did a big press conference. ""Alabama is receiving $1.3 trillion to make sure we have—we have all of Alabama—all of Alabama wired for the internet. It's going to be cheaper."" He voted against it, campaigned against it. I'm going down when he makes his announcement. We're going to be with him.
Now, look, I just think that the—you know, it's been a long time. But as I said, I think that—I don't think there's a thing we can't do if we set our mind to it. We can't kid each other though. This democracy is at stake. Not a joke. Not a joke.
One of the reasons why I did the Emmett Till thing was I wanted to make it clear that history is history. And that his mother, making sure there was an open coffin so people knew exactly what happened—knew exactly what happened—took an enormous amount of courage. And it was the Black press that exposed it and made people look at it.
Did you ever think you'd be in a country right now at your age and your circumstance where we're banning books? I just read—my wife wrote a book, not about politics at all—they took it out of libraries in Georgia. As we say in my religion, ""Bless me, Father, for I have sinned."" I mean, come on. I don't think that's who America is. I don't think that's the majority of Americans.
And with your help, we're going to make sure that it doesn't happen. That it does not—we don't get in a situation where we have a man who—if you just take what he said, on the record, I'm inclined—just a snippet—the stuff he said with him and run those ads, some would say it's just flat seditious. Not who we are.
And you're all successful people. You traveled abroad. Ask any of your compatriots—whether they're left, right, or center—what they think about—not me, but about if the other guy comes back.
We've got a lot to do, but we've got a lot of hope. A lot of hope.
As—every time I'd walk out of my Grandpop Finnegan's house up in Scranton, he was a—he went to Santa Clara and he was a newspaper guy and an All-American football player, by the way, in the days when they used to throw people over the line. [Laughter]
But he'd yell, ""Joey, keep the faith."" And my grandmother would yell, ""No, Joey, spread it."" Let's go spread the faith.

"July 27, 2023",Remarks on Efforts To Protect Communities From Extreme Heat,"
The President. Good afternoon.
We're here today with the mayors of Phoenix and San Antonio and senior members of my administration to talk about the existential threat of climate change. And it is a threat. We're going to outline steps we're taking to help communities who, right this minute, as both the mayors can tell you, are facing a real crisis in their cities.
We'll talk about steps we're taking to help people get through this tough time, and we're also going to talk about steps we're taking to help communities prepare, plan, and recover, and make our Nation more resilient in future heat waves. And there will be more.
I don't think anybody can deny the impact of the climate change anymore. There used to be a time when I first got here, a lot of people said, ""Oh, it's not a problem."" Well, I don't know anybody—well, I shouldn't say that—I don't know anybody who honestly believes climate change is not a serious problem.
Just take a look at the historic floods in Vermont and California earlier this year. Droughts and hurricanes that are growing more frequent and intense. Wildfires spreading a smoky haze for thousands of miles, worsening air quality. And record temperatures—and I mean record—are now affecting more than 100 million Americans.
Puerto Rico reached a 125-degree heat index last month. San Antonio hit an alltime heat index high of 117 last month. Phoenix has been over 110 degrees for 27 straight days.
And with El Niño and the short-term warming of the ocean that exacerbates the effects of climate change, making forecasts even hotter in the coming months.
Ocean temperatures near Miami are like stepping in a hot tub. They just topped 100 degrees—100 degrees—and they're hitting record highs around the world. And that's more like, as I said, jumping in a hot tub than jumping in an ocean to ride a wave.
Most people don't realize: For years, heat has been the—now, I have to admit I didn't know it either. I thought it—I knew it was tough, but the number-one weather-related killer is heat. The number-one weather-related killer is heat. Six hundred people die annually from its effects, more than from floods, hurricanes, and tornadoes in America combined. And even those places that are used to extreme heat have never seen it as hot as it is now for as long as it's been.
Even those who deny that we're in the midst of a climate crisis can't deny the impact that extreme heat is having on Americans. Americans like an elderly woman in Phoenix who fell out of her wheelchair and, after 5 minutes on the ground, had third-degree burns. Third-degree burns.
Or the firefighter who's—already has to lug over 45 pounds of gear through smoke and flame, which is incredibly hot. The job is even harder and more dangerous to do in record heat.
For the farmworkers who have to harvest crops in the dead of night to avoid the high temperatures. Or farmers who risk losing everything they've planted for the year.
Or the construction workers who literally risk their lives working all day in blazing heat and, in some places, don't even have the right to take a water break. That's outrageous. That is outrageous—anybody who says that—does that.
Folks, we really want to pretend these things are normal?
Experts say extreme heat is already costing America $100 billion a year. And it hits our most vulnerable the hardest: seniors, people experiencing homelessness who have nowhere to turn, disadvantaged communities that are the least able to recover from climate disasters.
And it's threatening farms, fisheries, forests that so many families depend on to make a living.
But none of this is inevitable. From day one of my administration, we've taken unprecedented action to combat the climate crisis that's causing this. We're using a law I got passed the first day in office—first month in office—called the American Rescue Plan, to help States and cities promote energy efficiency, reduce flooding, and open cooling centers.
We're delivering over $20 billion from the bipartisan infrastructure law to upgrade the electric grid to withstand stronger storms and heat waves so we don't cause more fires.
Look, last year I signed the Inflation Reduction Act, the most significant climate investment ever anywhere in the world. Meanwhile, FEMA has been on the ground responding to those unprecedented weather emergencies in real time. And I've traveled an awful lot in that helicopter with you all across the country and—to see the devastation that occurs, the kind of wildfires and other—and drought and the like.
We've launched a place you can go, heat.gov—go online to heat.gov—to share lifesaving information that you may need to know about.
Last year, my Department of Labor created the first-ever national program to protect workers from heat stress. Since then, we've conducted 2,600 heat-related inspections at workplaces nationwide to protect the health and safety of the workers on the job so they are being taken care of.
Today I'm announcing additional steps to help States and cities deal with the consequences of extreme heat.
First, I've asked Acting Labor Secretary Julie Su to issue a Heat Hazard Alert. It clarifies that workers have a Federal heat-related—have Federal heat-related protections. We should be protecting workers from hazardous conditions, and we will. And those States where they do not, I'm going to be calling them out, where they refuse to protect these workers in this awful heat.
Second, the Acting Secretary of Labor will work with her team to intensify enforcement, increasing inspections in high-risk industries like construction and agriculture.
This work builds on the national standard that the Labor Department is already developing for workforce and workplace heat-safety rules.
Meanwhile, the U.S. Forest Service will award more than $1 billion in grants to help cities and towns plant trees that in the long term will help repel the heat and expand access to green spaces so families have a place to go to cool off and to bring down the temperature in cities.
The Department of Housing and Urban Development is providing billions to communities to make buildings more efficient and to make more heat—make them more heat-resistant, opening cooling centers in—for residential areas and in the cities that the communities can go to to be safe.
The Department of the Interior is using infrastructure funding to expand water storage capacity in the Western States to deal with the impacts of future droughts that are made every—all this more extreme—this heat—this extreme heat more consequential.
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration is launching a new partnership with universities and impact communities to improve the Nation's weather forecasts and its accuracy so Americans everywhere can be better prepared when they—when—and they can better predict what the heat is going to be in that community with the weather.
In all my ""Investing in America"" agenda, we provided a record $50 billion for climate resiliency to restore wetlands, manage wildfires, help Americans in every State withstand extreme heat.
But our MAGA extremists in Congress are trying to undo all this progress. Not a single one of them—not a single Republican voted—voted for the Inflation Reduction Act, which had all this money for climate, which provides funding to combat climate change. And now many of them are trying to repeal those provisions, but we're not going to let that happen.
Part of the reason we're here today is to get the word out so State and local governments know these resources are available and uses them. I want the American people to know help is here and we're going to make it available to anyone who needs it.
Follow guidance from the local leaders and public safety officials when you hear it in your cities and towns and States. Stay indoors if you're vulnerable. Be careful on hot pavement. Know the signs of heat stroke, like headache, nausea, dizziness. And always have water with you. That sounds silly, but always have a bottle of water with you when you're outside.
Check on loved ones and neighbors who may not have air conditioning, and check on them on a regular basis. Or go to the mall or community centers or movie theaters or libraries where there is air conditioning when you don't have that air conditioning at home.
Take advantage of local cooling centers. Hundreds are being built. They're there for everyone, and they save lives. It matters.
Now I'm going to turn it over to the mayor of Phoenix, who's on the frontlines of dealing with extreme heat.
And fire away, Mayor. We're anxious to hear what you have to say.
[At this point, Mayor Kate S. Gallego of Phoenix, AZ, spoke via videoconference as follows.]
Mayor Gallego Thank you so much, President Biden. Thank you for convening us today to talk about something near and dear to my heart and on so many of our minds: extreme heat.
We really appreciate your leadership on climate change with legislation such as the Inflation Reduction Act that will be the most important in a generation.
Phoenix is known for heat. We are often called the Valley of the Sun. We have relentless summer heat followed by beautiful months of weather. But right now this summer has really been unprecedented. And you've spoken about some of the challenges we have faced here in Phoenix. It's taking a real toll on our community.
We feel like we are very much on the frontlines of climate change.
The President. You are.
Mayor Gallego. I've tried to make—and it's—man, you can feel it outside today. We have—I've tried to make it my mission to adapt to this trend, to stay ever innovative, and ensure we aren't falling behind on heat resilience.
We're working to outinnovate climate change, but we need to work together to make sure all of us are on deck to address it. We need a whole-of-Government approach. Phoenix is the first in the Nation to have a permanent publicly funded heat office. They love the data that NOAA and your Federal Government is putting out to help us.
Our emergency personnel and heat-ready volunteers are working diligently to keep residents safe through targeted outreach on heat safety, park trail closures, and timely responses to help our most vulnerable.
The heat is a challenge for folks who don't have access to adequate AC or who are outdoors most of the day, so a large part of our efforts is getting residents inside as much as possible. We do it in a variety of ways through cooling centers located across the country—the county, mobile cooling units, respite centers, and encouraging hydration at one of our many water stations.
We also recognize that many families need assistance to make their air conditioners more effective or need Federal aid with their energy bills. And Federal dollars have just been crucial in supporting families' abilities to make their homes safer and more comfortable.
The Department of Energy's Weatherization Assistance Program makes homes more energy efficient, lowering energy bills for the long haul, reducing overload on the grid, and making homes more comfortable in intense heat.
Paired with the incredible incentives in the Inflation Reduction Act for residential solar, this can make an enormous impact for families. And Mayor Nirenberg, who's joining us, has been a real leader and a model for mayors in how to communicate all the good things that are in the IRA to our residents.
The HHS Low-Income Household Energy Assistance Program, LIHEAP, has been crucial for low-income families to help with energy bills. Even when the heat is over, many of our families may see their largest ever energy bill in their mailboxes.
And we're among the many warm-weather communities asking for balanced consideration of how these formulas are structured. Expanding these solutions would have immediate impact for families.
We are also using ARPA dollars to address heat. And we are looking forward to applying for the funding for trees, which could really go a long way in making our communities more comfortable, that you have secured in the Inflation Reduction Act.
We deal with this heat on an annual basis. So we've been focused on preparedness from day one and really trying to prepare for what is, for us, a long-term emergency.
You mentioned how many lives are lost to heat, and that's a real focus for us. We would love it if Congress would give you the ability to declare heat a disaster. We think that could really save additional aid, and that would even more multiply the impact of FEMA Hazard Mitigation Assistance and Building Resistant—Resilience Infrastructure—the BRIC programs, which are a good start to building long-term solutions, such as energy redundancy for cooling centers.
So we feel like there are a lot of great tools. And I appreciate you helping communities across the country just make sure they're aware of the great ways the Federal Government is partnering. We're looking forward to working with you to become even more effective.
Thank you.
The President. Well, Kate, thank you very much.
Look, you've established the Office of Heat Response and Mitigation. And sometimes—I think those of us in Government do this all the time: We think everybody knows what all these titles and all these acronyms mean. But can you give me—share some examples of the work and the outreach that you're doing in the community to try to let people know what's available and how you can help? I mean, what kinds of thing—because I find that's the difficult thing to do sometimes.
Mayor Gallego. Absolutely. We're getting better every year, and we learn every year. We're trying to get out and share maps of where all the cooling centers are to deliver cooling kits.
You mentioned checking on loved ones. We have a formal program called ""Cool Callers"" at the city of Phoenix——
The President. Good for you.
Mayor Gallego. ——where we can—you can register your family members or if you know you might need a check during the heat of the summer. And we would love for more people to sign up to be checked on.
It's a—the volunteers have been amazing. We've had thousands of engagement. And just having that permanent office has given us a place for people to go both with ideas and when they want to volunteer. And we've been able to use some of your Federal programs, including trying to find new ways to build housing indoors so that our construction workers are safer.
So we appreciate the partnership. It's made our heat office more effective.
The President. Well, it's not going to alleviate it right—the heat problem right now, but we also have a number of programs to do everything from allow people to have the ability to get help to literally paint their roofs white, to change the—their windows and doors, to get tax credits for doing it so heat doesn't—so air conditioning doesn't escape, to be able—there's a whole bunch of programs that are out there that, as we get through the heat wave, that we're—well, as we get by this worst part, that we're able to invest in the communities to keep it from happening as badly next time it occurs.
And so I'm looking forward to working with you, and I thank you for your leadership.
Mr. Mayor, how are you doing, man?
[Mayor Ronald A. Nirenberg of San Antonio, TX, spoke via videoconference as follows.]
Mayor Nirenberg. Doing great, Mr. President.
The President. I hope the air I hope the air conditioning is working. [Laughter]
Mayor Nirenberg. So far, so good, Mr. President. It's great to be here with you and your team and with Mayor Gallego.
And I first want to start by thanking you, Mr. President, for the invitation today and want to extend my sincerest gratitude for your administration for the wealth of the support that San Antonio communities garnered through extensive and substantive investments in our housing stock—affordable housing stock, our workforce training efforts, as well as sustainable physical infrastructure.
But today we are here to talk about what has become a dangerous heat wave across large swaths of the southern part of our country, including here in Texas. To that end, San Antonio is certainly thankful for a President who's willing to tackle this urgent crisis in an equitable manner.
The bipartisan infrastructure law and the Inflation Reduction Act's commitment to the Justice40 climate initiative is also reflected on our local San Antonio Climate Ready Plan, as 75 percent of San Antonio's population are communities of color disproportionately impacted by decades of local inaction.
The President. Yes.
Mayor Nirenberg. But times are changing, thankfully. Sustainability and green energy are no longer four-letter words in the State of Texas. We will——
The President. At least among most of you Texans—at least among most Texans. [Laughter]
Mayor Nirenberg. Well, I'm happy to say that——
The President. I'm not——
Mayor Nirenberg. ——here in San Antonio, we've taken leadership. And——
The President. You have.
Mayor Nirenberg. ——and in 2028, we will end the use of coal in San Antonio, which is nearly 40 years ahead of schedule.
And in large part because of you, Mr. President, San Antonio will launch its first-ever Advanced Rapid Transit line, bona fide mass transit for the city of San Antonio, a service that will only include low- or no-emission vehicles.
And so, as San Antonio works towards greener development in transit, we're also doing our policy work. Our—we changed our development code last year to require 240-volt level 2 chargers in all new single-family homes. We're also providing incentives for those chargers in multifamily residences.
And also having the Nation's largest municipally owned utility, San Antonio has now become the fifth largest solar producer in the United States and tops in Texas——
The President. Congratulations on that, by the way. Congratulations.
Mayor Nirenberg. Thank you very much. We're going to reach for number one in the country. We're number one in Texas, but we're not going to stop.
However, these initiatives are just—are not just happening in San Antonio. I'm pleased to report mayors are united in Texas as well. Communities across Texas have committed themselves to being greener, more equitable, and literally cooler, as nearly every major Texas city now has a long-term climate or emissions reduction strategy.
So, working with our partners at the White House, with you and your team, I'm confident that the State best known for oil and gas production can help lead the way to a greener tomorrow.
So thank you again to your entire team, Mr. President, for your efforts to help us realize a better tomorrow for us, for our children, and for our grandchildren.
The President. Well, Ron, thank you. And I'm not being solicitous when I say this: You know, most people don't realize that Texas is one of the States that has the most significant—its energy is most significantly supplied by wind and solar, in Texas—in Texas.
And I know there are some in your State that want to change—turn that around. But it's working, and it's moving in a big way. And it's cheaper. It's cheaper.
Mayor Nirenberg. And it saved our necks in this heat wave too, by the way.
The President. Well, I think so. For real. I mean, look, most people have—grew up in families like I did, where you've just got to worry about one day to the next and getting enough food on the table. I mean, not poor but you know, just taking care of business, making sure your kids are okay.
But I—the change that's taking place in Texas as it relates to dealing with the generation of energy is really magnificent. I mean, it's really incredible.
And I'm sure that—anyway, I won't—I shouldn't get into all that. But the fact is—you know, while your long-term plans take shape, what are you doing in the near term to protect your residents from the heat wave?
Mayor Nirenberg. Well, I certainly appreciate that question and very much appreciate the actions that you're taking today, Mr. President, through the Department of Labor.
As you know, Texas cities are in a battle with the State for local control. But we're going to do everything possible to protect our most vulnerable workers, especially those outdoor workers, for basic things like being able to access water breaks.
The President. Yes.
Mayor Nirenberg. San Antonio also is the first—taking a page from Mayor Gallego's book, we're the first major city in Texas to pilot a citywide cool pavement initiative.
I'm also pleased to report that, next week, city council will vote to allocate an additional $4 million for tree planting, for mitigating our urban heat island effect.
And for the most immediate needs right now during this heat island—or during this heat wave—we have 80 cooling centers located all around the city—pools, splash pads, libraries, et cetera. And we're offering free transportation to any resident who needs to get located into one of those indoor cooling centers.
And for our homeless population, we are conducting extensive outreach to make sure that we can get them into cool places and nobody is out there in the elements.
The President. Well, thank you. And look, don't hesitate to call us direct. For real.
I mean, there's so much—no, I really mean it. There's so much out there that we can do. And we've funded an awful lot of this.
For example, the idea that you can't have mandatory water breaks when you're working on a construction? Hell, when I played football, if you had a coach who, during the spring—during summer practice, didn't provide water, you know, on a regular basis, he got in trouble or got fired. I mean, what are we doing here? What's going on with some of this stuff?
Both of you are—totally different place. But people just need to know where to go and what to do. And we're going to provide a lot of help across the board. And I'm looking forward to working with both of you.
For example, we should—on the international effort, we've got a commitment to, you know, plant a billion trees over the next several years worldwide. I mean, there's a reason why—anyway, you guys get it. And—but we've got to get through this crisis in the near term, and we've got to keep people safe.
And I really appreciate it. Because, look, I think talking to you both—people make judgments about whether you have a heart or not, whether you really are—whether it's just rote, you're telling them, or you care.
I mean this sincerely; you guys know this. Well, you both care, and it comes across. And so people are more inclined to say, ""Okay, I'll take a chance on maybe going to that center, or maybe I'll take a chance on doing A, B, C, or D.""
People are reluctant. And what you're both doing substantively, what we're going to be able to help you do more substantively, but what you're doing and the way you're doing it, I really admire you for doing it. I really mean it.
So thank you, thank you, thank you. Appreciate it.
And I want to thank my team for the work they're doing too to combat extreme heat and other historic weather emergencies we're seeing all across the country.
We are making progress. But as we've heard today, we have a lot more work to do.
I look forward to working with not just—just this two—these two wonderful mayors, but officials all across on the frontlines and local officials. Local officials are where the rubber meets the road, no pun intended. It's—really matters.
We're committed to getting you what you need to keep your community safe, because no one knows what you need more for your communities than you guys. And so thank you, thank you, thank you.
And I mean it: Don't hesitate to contact any of the departments standing behind me. We have some of the funds. We're working—going to get more. And I think we can make a difference.
So thank you both. And as my mother would say, ""God love you.""
Thanks. See you all.
Q. Mr. President, are you—[inaudible]—pardoning your son? [Inaudible]—pardon for your son?

"July 27, 2023",Remarks Prior to a Meeting With Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni of Italy,"
President Biden. Well, it's a delight to welcome the Prime Minister. We have become friends. And it's good to have you back at the White House. Thank you for coming.
Prime Minister Meloni. Thank you.
President Biden. And let me offer my condolences over the—in Italy and throughout the Mediterranean, to those suffering from extreme, extreme weather and wildfires. Italy and the region are grappling with this, just as we are here in the United States.
I just did a major initiative on the dangers of this excessive heat here in the United States. And we're grappling with it as well.
And as NATO allies, the transatlantic partnership is the cornerstone of our shared security. And the Italian troops are playing a critical role in Europe, in the Mediterranean, and beyond.
Italy and the United States are also standing strong with Ukraine. And I compliment you on your very strong support in defending against Russian atrocities. And that's what they are. It's not just a war, but they're—Russia is committing atrocities that they're focusing on. Well, I don't want to get into it.
But you know—and I thank the Italian people. I want to thank them for supporting you in supporting Ukraine. It makes a big difference.
Today we're going to talk about our deepening economic connections, which fueled more than $100 billion in trade last year. In my view, there's no reason why that can't increase. And we're also expanding the partnership in new areas, including space cooperation and strengthening our support for developing countries. And I look forward to our discussion today on Mediterranean—the work with Mediterranean nations to address the legitimate migration challenges you have coming in from Africa.
And Italy is going to be leading the G-7 this next time around and—next year. And I also look forward to pursuing an ambitious agenda for progress. And I hope you'll be nice to me as the chairman. [Laughter]
Thank you.
Prime Minister Meloni. Thank you.
President Biden. Please.
Prime Minister Meloni. Thank you. I am very pleased to be here today to testify the deep friendship that bonds the United States and Italy. I want to thank President Biden for his hospitality. And this closeness is based on common values and cultural roots.
And our bond was made strong by the contribution of millions of Americans of Italian origin. And that means Italy is an integral part of the great American nation and contributed in shaping its culture and identity.
And also for that, our relations are historically strong. They cross governments and remain solid regardless of their political colors.
We know who our friends are in times that are tough. And I think that Western nations have shown that they can rely on each other much than some have believed.
Moreover, after the Russian aggression against Ukraine, for all together we decided to defend the international law. And I'm proud that Italy, from the beginning, played its part in it. We did it simply because supporting Ukraine means defending the peaceful coexistence of people and states everywhere in the world.
Contrary to what some claim, Ukrainian resistance distances a world war. It does not bring it closer, as some say. Those who believe in peace should be the first supporters of the Ukrainian cause.
And then, Italy and the United States have important common interests in enhancing, as well, a global trade that is not only free, but also fair. Competition from other nations that do not meet our standards in terms of worker protection, safety, environmental protection undermine our companies and workers.
So free trade without rules has shown its limits. We must find the right balance between openness and the protection of our economy—economies and strategic interests.
And similarly, we will discuss also these within the West. We must work together to support our industrial system by fostering convergence on our national interests. In this respect, dialogue between us—between Italy, Europe, United States—can avoid counterproductive tension to the benefit of everyone.
And on the other hand, we also need to be fair with nations that feel they have been exploited of their resources and that they show distrust towards the West. President Biden knows I take care a lot about Africa, about the role that we can play in these countries that can help us, building with them a new relation based on a new approach, which is a peer-to-peer approach. Also to fight illegal migration and all the problems that we face.
It's all things that we will discuss in the G-7 Presidency of Italy next year.
And then, United States is our most important trade partner outside European Union. And I think—I do agree with you, Joe—that our trade partnership is very high, but no reason why we could not improve it.
So thank you very much for hosting us, and thank you for your time.
President Biden. Well, I think you made an interesting point about the closeness and how many Italian Americans there are here.
And I just want you to know I was raised in a neighborhood where I felt self-conscious my name didn't end in ""o."" And I want you to know I'm the only non-Italian named Man of the Year by the Italian Society.
And I—when I got the award, I said to everybody what—[inaudible]—wanted to know what I was going to say. I said, ""You know, I was thinking about this."" I named all the guys and families I grew up with—[inaudible]. Anyway, I went through the list. And I said: ""I was thinking about it. I deserve this award."" [Laughter]
And—but I may be Irish, but I'm not stupid. I married Dominic Giacoppo's granddaughter. Just want you to know that. Okay? So be nice to me. All right? [Laughter]
Prime Minister Meloni. Now I know it.
President Biden. Anyway, thank you all very much.
Prime Minister Meloni. Thank you very much.

"July 27, 2023",Remarks at the Truman Civil Rights Symposium,"
Hello, hello. Thank you. Please—please be seated.
You know, I had an opportunity to meet members of the Truman Board. And we were talking about all that Harry Truman did. And I was reminded—and I will—I'm going to send the—the Truman Library a copy of it.
My grandpop was an Irishman named Ambrose Finnegan. And I lived in Scranton until—until the economy just drew down and there was no work. My dad was a salesperson. And we moved down to Delaware—Claymont, Delaware.
We would go home all the time to Scranton. And one day, we went back to—I was back in Scranton, and a lot of my friends—I moved there to Delaware when I was in third grade, but we had been home a lot. We still called Scranton home and—and we were up there on St. Patrick's Day when I was 14 years old. And I was standing on the corner watching everybody go by; they're going to the event.
And Harry Truman was a speaker at the Truman Dinner that year. And the—sort of the David Broder of the Scranton Times—it was a guy named Tommy Phillips, who was an elderly man—younger than me, but elderly man—[laughter]—who was the chief political reporter. And they got a picture—and I hadn't thought about it a long time, but I'll send it over to the library—of me at 14 years old standing on the corner in a—and it was a warm day for February. And I'm standing on the corner in long-sleeve shirt with my buddies.
And President Truman was coming around the corner, coming off of Dimmick Avenue, and he was in a convertible. And purely by accident—I assume it was an accident—the photographer from the newspaper got a picture of me making eye contact with Harry Truman. It was just—I'm sure a lot of people made eye contact with him—[laughter]—but I was looking and you can see in the photograph we're looking at one another eye to eye. And that's when this—Tommy Phillips, the David Broder of the day in Scranton, wrote, ""That's when Joe Biden knew he was going to be President."" [Laughter]
I knew I was going to be President when Jim Clyburn went ahead and endorsed me. That's when I knew I was going to be President. Thank you, Jim.
This is a great honor to be here tonight, and I mean that sincerely.
Summer 1918. The first war—world war. A train moves through the outskirts of Paris. An American Army captain rides alongside an all-White regiment heading to the frontlines.
A son of a slave State, the grandson of slaveowners, Captain Harry S. Truman looks through his glasses toward the blood-stained soil of the Second Battle of the Marne that ended just a few months before. It was a pivotal victory that led the vital part of America's—led by the vital part of America's 369th Infantry Regiment: the Harlem Hellfighters, an all-Black regiment that spent 191 days on the front, longer than any unit of its size in history.
A link in a distinguished line of ancestors and descendants, enslaved and free, risking their lives in every war since our founding for ideals they hadn't fully known on American soil: equality and freedom. A fearless captain on a consecrated battlefield in a segregated military. A snapshot in time of the work of all time to redeem the soul of America, which we're still struggling to do.
Representatives Clyburn and Cleaver, the Truman family, and leaders of the Truman Institute, distinguished guests, my fellow Americans, I speak to you tonight not from a battlefield, but from another sacred place: the National Archives, home of timeless words that point to our North Star.
A light for the dreams and the pains of centuries of enslaved people in America.
An idea once the most simple and the most powerful idea in the history of the world: that we're all created equal, endowed by our Creator with certain inalienable rights, and deserve to be treated with equality not just in the beginning, but throughout our lives.
A covenant—a covenant we made with each other so central to who we are that we enshrined it in our Declaration of Independence: ""We hold these truths to be self-evident."" Our Constitution: ""We the people."" Our Bill of Rights: with the freedom of religion, speech, press, assembly, and more. All safeguarded in this hallowed place.
History requires us to acknowledge that we have never fully lived up to the promise of America captured in the essence of these documents. But our aspirations to be a more perfect Union ensure that we never fully walked away from it either.
Just like Army—just like the Army captain who became President of the United States of America walked toward our North Star when he signed Executive Order—that Jim mentioned—9981 that desegregated the United States Armed Forces on July 26, 1948—75 years as of yesterday.
Harry Truman, born in Missouri to a family and community that embraced the Confederate sympathies. But savage violence and venom toward Black veterans and the power of the civil rights movement changed his mind and his heart.
Guided by a prayer he memorized as a child, and the prayer went like this: ""Oh, almighty and everlasting God, creator of Heaven, Earth, and universe, help me to be, to think, to act what is right because it is right."" That was the prayer he memorized, and I—history says he spoke to.
When the time came, Harry Truman did what—a very American thing: He rose to the occasion, and he chose to do right.
The American military had been segregated since our founding, yet hundreds of thousands—hundreds of thousands of people of color, men and women, still courageously served with a love of country that often didn't love them back.
They served in our Revolutionary War, declaring independence from a king only to be enslaved by a master. They protected the Union in the Civil War only to face disunion under Jim Crow. They sacrificed during two World Wars, fighting against autocracy only to be denied the freedom of their own democracy.
They are patriots like the Buffalo Soldiers: legends for their valor in combat. The Tuskegee Airmen, flying more than 15,000 sorties into battle.
Native Americans serving in our military at the highest rate of any demographic and nearly five times the national average.
Hispanic Americans, like those in the 65th Regiment—Infantry Regiment helping liberate a Nazi concentration camp and protect Allied roads and airfields and posts.
Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians, Pacific Islanders, like the 442d Regimental Combat Team liberating Europe, a team that included one of my dearest and closest friends and a mentor of mine when I got here as a 29-year-old kid: the late Senator Danny Inouye, who served in the Senate with another friend, a great Hawaiian veteran: the late Senator Daniel Akaka.
The list goes on, including rank-and-file cooks, custodians, secretaries, mailmen, too often overlooked and forgotten, but made it work.
Yet, when these veterans came home, they were still denied equal opportunity in housing, education, jobs, even marriage. Families held in incarceration camps. Many of them denied the benefits of the GI bill because the States—the States put up barriers to be able to collect that GI benefit. And targeted in racist violence that was callous and all too often casual and common.
Let me take you back to 1946. Jim already spoke to this: February, South Carolina. Sergeant Isaac Woodard, a decorated Black World War II veteran, saw 3 years of war in the Pacific. Returning home to finally see his family, he asked the bus driver to stop so he could use the restroom. Instead, the driver called the police.
On arrival, the cops pulled him off the bus while he was still in uniform, beat him so badly they permanently blinded him. Beat him so badly they blinded him. And he was in his uniform.
I'm still astounded by the cruelty and viciousness.
Sergeant Woodard reunited with his family, but he could never look into their eyes again.
Five months later, July in Georgia. Army veteran George Dorsey, who spent 5 years in the Pacific—home with his wife for just 10 months. They were driving with his brother-in-law and sister, who was 7 months pregnant, when a White mob attacked them, pulled them from their car, and fired 60 shots—60—60 shots at close range, leaving their bodies barely identifiable.
My God, how sick. It's unbelievable what racism fueled by ignorance can unleash in this country.
The next month, August 1946, in response to similar acts of racist terror, a 17-year-old college student wrote a letter to the Atlanta Constitution, and here's what he said. He said, quote, ""We want and are entitled to the basic rights and opportunities of every American citizen."" End of quote.
That was a college student at Morehouse College. His name was Martin Luther King, Jr.
But a young King wasn't the only person awakened. A President was awakened as well.
Harry Truman felt a moral imperative to respond to the mistreatment of Black veterans. He heard their calls for a ""Double Victory"" to win freedom abroad and at home. He felt the urgency from civil rights leaders like A. Philip Randolph and the NAACP.
An unlikely character in the civil rights story of America, Harry Truman set his sights on our North Star. He created the President's Commission on Civil Rights that issued the groundbreaking report entitled, ""To Secure These Rights""—that was the title, ""To Secure These Rights""—condemning segregation and outlawing—outlining, I should say, changes in law and policy: protecting the right to vote, prohibiting discrimination in jobs and transportation, desegregating the military, and much more.
But as you might guess, the backlash was instant—instant.
A friend wrote to him, pleading to change course, but President Truman wrote back, quote: ""I am asking for equality of opportunity for all human beings. And as long as I stay here, I'm going to continue to fight."" End of quote.
Members of his own party, members of the military rejected the civil—his civil rights agenda. Undeterred, Harry Truman acted. And we're much better a nation—a much better nation for his courage and commitment and for the sacrifice and service of all our patriots who fought for our democracy.
This year commemorates two other significant milestones: the 75th anniversary of women in the military and the 50th anniversary of an All-Volunteer Force. And as Commander in Chief, I'm honored to oversee the greatest fighting force—literally, not figuratively—in the history of the world. And that's not hyperbole. And I might add: the most diverse fighting force in the history of the world. And, folks, these two parts are not—these two points are not unrelated.
More than 40 percent of our Active Duty force are people of color. Forty percent. About 20 percent are women, up from just 2 percent in 1948. A fighting immigrant force and those native born, hailing from big cities, suburbs, small towns, Tribal communities.
As our military became more diverse, it became stronger, tougher, and more capable, proving our diversity is a strength, not a weakness; a necessary part of our warfighting and our deterrence and our successful military operations.
And our unity out of many, not division, ensures good order and discipline, unit cohesion, effectiveness, and military readiness. We've seen it with generations of patriots, regardless of who they are mentored by and trained by. Fellow servicemen from every background, like my friend, the late Colin Powell—he was a friend.
Like so many veterans I've had the privilege to award our Nation's highest honors. Working toward the same mission, forming lifelong friendships, returning home to put on civilian clothes and enrich every part of American life. Bonding through a deep love of our Nation that draws our greatest strengths and our greatest strategic assets the full talents of all the American people—and I mean that. Think about it. The full—of all the American people.
Some of you are tired of hearing me saying it, but I've been saying it for many years: We have many obligations as a government. We only have one truly sacred obligation: to prepare and equip those we send into harm's way and care for them and their families when they come home and when they don't.
For me and my wife Jill, for our family, it's personal, like many of you.
Among the most important duties, Jill and I have stood at Arlington to undertake the rite of remembrance so we have back home—as we have back home in Delaware for our son, Major Beau Biden, Bronze Star, Conspicuous Service Medal.
In fact, Jill couldn't be here tonight because she just returned from Europe, where she paid her respects at the Brittany American Cemetery, the final resting place of thousands of Americans, World War II troops.
It matters to Vice President Harris and our entire administration. It matters that we have the best leaders to lead the best force in the world that represent our entire country. From my perspective, that's America. That's America.
It includes the first-ever Black Secretary of Defense, who wanted to be here tonight, but he's traveling to the Indo-Pacific to strengthen our security ties in the region. Secretary Lloyd Austin, a decorated former four-star general, a warfighter with more than 40 years of service embodying the very spirit of why we are here tonight.
And there is Deputy Defense Secretary Kathleen Hicks, a prodigious scholar and leader, the first woman confirmed as Deputy Secretary of Defense. It's also—I also got confirmed two four-star generals that lead our common—our combatant commands, the second and third women in history to do so. It matters.
But something dangerous is happening. I've worked across the aisle my entire career; I think my colleagues will attest to that. I have good friends who are Republicans. We disagree. A guy I disagree like the devil with, but is a decent and honorable man and does what he says is the Republican leader in the Senate. We disagree on almost everything.
The Republican Party used to always support the military. But today, they are undermining the military. The senior Senator from Alabama, who claims to support our troops, is now blocking more than 300 military operations [nominations; White House correction] with his extreme political agenda.
Like General C.Q. Brown, F-16 pilot and a wing commander and the first African American to lead any branch of the Armed Service to be the next Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. That's who I've nominated. He's waiting.
Admiral Lisa Franchetti, the second woman in our Navy ever to achieve the rank of four-star admiral, who I chose to be—make history again as the first woman as Chief of Naval Operations.
I've also nominated other outstanding leaders of all backgrounds. We need them.
Right now tens of thousands of America's daughters and sons are deployed around the world tonight keeping us safe from immense national security challenges. But the Senator from Alabama is not. For the first time in more than 100 years, we don't have a sitting confirmed Commandant of the Marine Corps. By the fall, we may not have a Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. We might not have the military leaders for our Army and Navy either.
This partisan freeze is already harming military readiness, security, leadership, and troop morale; freezing pay; freezing people in place. Military families who have already sacrificed so much, unsure of where and when they change stations, unable to get housing or start their kids in the new school because they're not there yet. Military spouses forced to take critical career decisions, not knowing where or if they can apply for a new job.
A growing cascade of damage and disruption, all because one Senator from Alabama and 48 Republicans who refuse to stand up to him, to lift the blockade over the Pentagon policy offering service men and women, their families access to reproductive health care rights they deserve if they're stationed in States that deny it.
I think it's outrageous. But don't just take it from me. Hundreds of military spouses petitioned to end the extreme blockade. One spouse referencing the Senator from Alabama said, quote: ""This isn't a football game. This nonsense must stop right now."" Enough.
It's time for the Senate to confirm the next Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the next Commandant of the Marine Corps. It's time for servicemembers to receive the pay and promotions they've earned and deserve. It's time for the Senator of Alabama to let these generals and admirals fully serve their country and servicemembers care for themselves and their families.
I urge Senate Republicans to do what they know is right: Keep our country safe like Harry Truman. Approve all those outstanding military nominees now—now—now—which was routine in the past, I might add.
And enough with the attacks on our military from those voices slandering American military, saying it's becoming weak, soft, and less capable.
We hear it from the senior Senator from Missouri, who held his fist high in salute of January 6 even as veterans turned police officers protected him and our Nation as insurrectionists held a dagger at the throat of democracy.
We hear it from the junior Senator from Texas who fell for Russian propaganda suggesting that their military—the Russian military—was better than ours, calling our military ""emasculated."" Where the he- —[laughter]—sorry.
Frankly, they have no idea what in God's name they're talking about.
As Commander in Chief, I can tell you without reservation—not just being in this business for a long time, but being a student of history—we have and always will have the strongest, toughest—[inaudible]—force—fighting force in the history of the world. And, again, that's not hyperbole. That's real.
I'm sorry to go on, but, as my grandpop would say, this gets my goat. [Laughter]
Let me close with this: In June of 1865, a major general from the Union Army arrived in Galveston, Texas, to enforce the Emancipation Proclamation and free the last enslaved Americans from bondage. Juneteenth, a day that reflects the Psalm—what the Psalm tells us, quote, ""Weeping may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the morning.""
Last month, 2 years after I made Juneteenth a Federal holiday—the first new Federal holiday since Martin Dr. Martin Luther King Day, nearly 40 years ago—I hosted a Juneteenth concert at the White House—the beacon of our Republic, I might add, built by enslaved people.
Watching their descendants—students, dancers, singers—perform in that lawn of the White House was spiritual. To think thousands—thousands—of Black Union soldiers killed during the Civil War. To think enslaved people remained shackled 2 years after emancipation. To think how many long nights they looked to the light and the North Star to keep the faith that despite America's original sin of slavery, this Nation could be saved.
That is patriotism. That's patriotism.
During that powerful concert, we heard the great Jennifer Hudson sing from her soul about the glory that will come and echo an anthem of a movement. I can't sing, so I'm not even going to try. [Laughter] But I'll quote, ""It's been a long time coming, but I know a change is gonna come. Oh, yes, it will.""
That's what happened 75 years ago when an American President chose to do right. And that's what we commemorate tonight: a forward march in our own lives, in the life of the Nation, toward the North Star, the idea of America that beats in the heart of all of our people.
I know we'll do this. I've never been more optimistic about America's future. Let us reflect and repair. Let us rise to the occasion and redeem the soul of this Nation, treat each other with decency and respect, change the dialogue.
Let's remember who in God's name we are. We are the United States of America, and there's nothing—think about this—literally, there is nothing we've ever set our mind to we haven't accomplished—nothing, ever—if we decided we were going to do it. Nothing beyond our capacity when we act together.
So let's reach out, even to those who have—less than generous. Try to pull them in so we can act together.
And I mean this from the bottom of my heart: May God bless you all, and may God protect our troops.

"July 25, 2023",Remarks on Efforts To Expand Access to Mental Health Care,"
Please, have a seat. Richele, thank you for that introduction and the courage it takes to stand up—[laughter]—on national television in front of all these people and tell your story. But your story is the story of millions of people all across the country.
And you know, one of the things that the pandemic demonstrated is the need for a lot more help. Over a million people dead from COVID. And that's estimated to mean 8 million people left behind who were close to them. How many mornings people get up or show up for dinner and there's an empty chair? The impact on people's lives is profound.
But—and you were paying insurance every month. You know, you shouldn't be your own—well, you shouldn't have to do what you had to do, going through one of the hardest things in life.
And by the way, Debbie, Debbie, Debbie—God love you. [Laughter] You're the best, Debbie. You really are. We wouldn't be here were it not for Debbie, and that's not a—that's not an exaggeration. We served together for a long time in the Senate, and I've never known you not to be a significant advocate for this very issue.
And I want to thank Acting Secretary Su and everyone at the Department of Labor and HHS and Treasury for working to improve insurance coverage for mental health care in America.
And, folks, you know, I don't know what the difference between breaking your arm and having a mental breakdown is. It's health. There is no distinction. It's health. Vivek Murthy, who is our Surgeon General, and I talk about this issue a lot.
You know, in the last two State of the Union Addresses, I've laid out what I call the unity agenda. It is made up of four big things to—that we're going to do together as a nation. One of the things I'm always asked is: You know, why Americans have sort of lost faith for a while on being—being able to do big things.
""If you could do anything at all, Joe, what would you do?"" I said, ""I'd cure cancer."" And they looked at me like, ""Why cancer?"" Because no one thinks we can. That's why. And we can. We can end cancer as we know it.
Deliver on our sacred obligations to veterans is the second thing I think is critically important. Thirdly was beat the opioid epidemic, which we're still fighting very hard. And fourth was to tackle mental health crisis, which is why we're here today.
You know, we can all agree mental health care is health care. It is health care. It's essential to people's well-being and their ability to lead a full and productive life, to find joy, to find purpose, to take care of themselves and their loved ones. It's about dignity. Think about this.
My dad used to have an expression: Everyone is entitled to be treated with dignity. Imagine being a parent looking at your beautiful child you adore needing help and know you can't do a damn thing about it because you don't have the wherewithal. You can't—talk about stripping a parent of their dignity—their inability to help their child or their husband or their wife or their mother or their father or someone they adore.
But right now, for millions of Americans, mental health care and treatment for substance abuse is out of reach. It's out of reach. In 2020, less than half—less than half—of all adults with mental illness diagnosis received care for it. Less than half.
For children the numbers are even worse. Nearly 70 percent of our kids who seek care for mental health or addiction cannot get it. Seventy percent.
Talk to parents and teachers. Talk to the school nurses and counselors. Talk to young people. They'll tell you there's a serious youth mental health crisis happening right now in this country. We must fulfill the promise of true mental health parity for all Americans now. [Applause] Now.
And I might note, parenthetically: If we do, it saves the country billions of dollars. The idea that it's going to—it saves.
Here is what it means. Almost 15 years ago, the bipartisan Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act became law. It called for health insurance companies to cover mental health care and treatment for substance abuse at the same levels of physical health care. Because just like when you break your bone—a bone or have a heart attack, when you're having a mental health crisis, you should be able to get help—medical help, professional help.
During the Obama-Biden administration, we worked hard to put a law—this law into effect. And the result, by some important measures: There is greater parity—not nearly enough—greater parity today than in the past.
Look, there's lower copays for mental health care, getting rid of some arbitrary limits on the number of times you can see your therapist each year. Plus, for the first time ever, the Affordable Care Act made mental health care an essential service, which means many health plans must cover it.
But there were many important—these were important steps, but they weren't enough. We're still not where we need to be. We're still not there.
Insurers still make it far too difficult to get mental health care. Their networks of providers are badly inadequate, with far fewer psychiatrists, therapists, and other mental health professionals compared to all other mental—all other medical specialties.
And as a result, even with private insurance, patients are often forced to seek out-of-network care at significantly higher costs, if they can find it. Seeing a therapist can cost 200 bucks a visit or more. That's $800 a month if you have a session every week, which is often what patients need. Many families—a significant number of families—cannot afford that.
And by the way, think about—parenthetically, think about just how difficult it is to begin with, to say, ""I need help."" You break your arm, you have no trouble going to the emergency and—""I need help."" You're having a mental crisis, it's hard. It's hard to say ""I need help."" ""I need help."" ""My child needs help."" And this is happening to millions of people.
People with insurance are twice as likely to have to go out-of-network for mental health care compared to physical health care. And that gap has only gotten wider.
As a result, folks with depression, anxiety, posttraumatic stress, bipolar disorders, eating disorders, addiction, and other illnesses often go without care. Period. And you know the—how that ends, many times.
They try to power through and hope that they can manage on their own. Or they pay whatever it takes, spending down their savings, racking up credit card bills, or taking out second or third mortgages to get the care for themselves or their children.
Folks, it shouldn't be this way. It doesn't need to be this way.
I've heard from mental health professionals across the country describing a system that's falling short. One therapist wrote to me who primarily treats teenagers, including some who are having suicidal thoughts. And he said when his patients need to be hospitalized to save their lives, insurance companies often deny the claims—often deny the claims.
Another clinical psychologist wrote me and described getting calls from desperate people who have called 20 different therapists looking for help, but can't find it. This therapist says, and I quote, ""I try to create time that I don't have to see more patients."" End of quote. ""I'm often the only person,"" he went on to say, ""who is able to call them back."" They never even get calls, most of the time.
And I've personally received letters from family members whose loved ones are suffering from mental illness, who describe how difficult it can be to help.
One woman wrote me, went on to say—about her mother, a retired teacher who has a bipolar disorder. Her daughter wrote, quote, ""Too often, insurance companies dictate the standard of care when it actually needs to be care providers and family members who have more to say."" And she went on to say, ""Please advocate hard for the most vulnerable among us."" Well, that's exactly what my administration is trying to do.
Today my administration is announcing new steps to dramatically expand access to mental health care in America. Our plans would require health insurance plans to identify the gaps in the mental health care that they provide.
For example, they'd need to measure how many mental health providers are in their network, how much they are paying these providers, how difficult it is for someone to join their network, how often doctors have to get the so-called prior authorization before they can treat a patient.
Some of you have dealt with this more than once. You get referrals to see mental health specialists. But when you make the appointment, they say, ""I can't see you until your doctor submits the paperwork and gets special permission from the insurance company.""
Give me a break. [Laughter] It's ridiculous. It really is. [Applause] It's ridiculous. And it prevents people from getting the care they need.
Now insurance companies—now insurers are going to measure how often they require prior authorization and how often they deny those requests.
Right now many health plans don't collect data. Under my administration's new plan, they would be required to collect that data.
And under the existing law, when facts reveal that mental health care is not being treated on par with physical health care, they would be required by law to fix it. Fix it, fix it, fix it.
And here's something else we're announcing today. When mental—when the Mental Health Parity Act was passed 15 years ago, there was a loophole. Health plans that are offered to State and local government employees did not have to comply with the Mental Health Parity Act. More than 200 health plans nationwide were left out. Now we're making it clear: They have to follow the law as well. They must follow the law as well.
This builds on the work we've done over the past 2 years with the expanded Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinics. And I want to thank Debbie again, who for years worked to get this program up and running. She made sure it was funded in the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, which I was proud to sign into law, the largest investment in mental health ever, ever, ever, ever. Thank you, Debbie.
These clinics provide a range of services, including crisis support available 24 hours a day and 7 days a week. And they serve anyone who needs care regardless of their ability to pay.
There are now 500 of these clinics in 46 States. We've added more than 140 during my administration. And we're going to keep increasing the number because you need more than the 500.
We've also launched a nationwide crisis hotline: 8—excuse me—9-8-8. Let me say that again: The crisis hotline is 9-8-8, where you can connect with a trained crisis counselor 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Over 5 million people have called that hotline since I launched it a year ago—5 million. And we say we don't have a problem?
We've invested $1 billion to help schools hire, train—and train 14,000 new mental health counselors in schools across the country. And we're taking steps to address the harm of social media is doing to our young people. And it is doing harm.
We've got to hold—[applause]. We've got to hold these platforms accountable for the national experiment they're conducting on our children for profit.
Later this week, Senators will debate legislation to protect kids' privacy online, which I've been calling for for 2 years. It matters. Pass it, pass it, pass it, pass it, pass it. [Laughter] I really mean it. Think about it. Do you ever get a chance to look at what your kids are looking at online?
Folks, the actions we're announcing today represent a real step forward to help millions of people get mental health care they need and their insurance should be—and the insurance should be provided—it should be provided. But there's still so much more to do.
Improving our mental health system means addressing the three C's: coverage, care, and causes. Today, we took a big step on coverage. Now we need to keep expanding care, for example, by increasing access to telemedicine; expanding our mental health workshop—workforce—doctors, therapists, and counselors. Expanding it.
We need to address prevention and the root cause of the pain and trauma that a lot of people are feeling, like loneliness and isolation, social media and online bullying, gun violence.
And there's still—we're still feeling the profound loss of the pandemic. As I mentioned, we have over 100 [1 million; White House correction] people dead. That's 100 [1 million] empty chairs around the kitchen table. Every single loss, there are so many people left behind and broken-hearted.
Folks, this mental health crisis is something we need to face together as a country. We have a moral obligation, in my view, to be there for each other, to reach out—reach to our neighbors in grief and stress and trauma and despair. Reach out to them to offer help or just a listening ear; to have the courage to ask for help when we need it. And it's hard, because we know that even when it feels as dark as it can get, we aren't alone. It's important for people to realize that they're not alone.
That's what I want everyone—that's what I want for everyone in America: not to feel isolated and alone, to know their country has their back and their President has their back.
Let me close with this. Many people will have to seek mental health care at some point in their lives. Whether you're in a red State, a blue State, it doesn't matter.
Mental health care can be life-changing and even lifesaving. For all those brave enough and strong enough to seek help—and I mean that—brave enough and strong enough to seek help, we have to do better. Together, I know we will.
We just have to remember who we are, for God's sake. We're the United States of America. Think—we're the United—there is nothing beyond our capacity—nothing—nothing beyond our capacity when we do it together.
So God bless you all, and may God protect our troops. Thank you so very much.

"July 25, 2023",Remarks on Signing a Proclamation on the Establishment of the Emmett Till and Mamie Till-Mobley National Monument,"
Vice President Kamala D. Harris. Good afternoon, everyone. Please have seat. Good afternoon.
To our President, Joe Biden; Members of Congress; the members of the Till family; and my fellow Americans: Today we gather to remember our history. We gather to remember an act of astonishing violence and hate and to honor the courage of those who called upon on our Nation to look with open eyes at that horror and to act.
The story of Emmett Till and the incredible bravery of Mamie Till-Mobley helped fuel the movement for civil rights in America, and their stories continue to inspire our collective fight for justice.
When I served in the United States Senate, I was so profoundly honored to sponsor the Emmett Till Antilynching Act alongside Congressman Bobby Rush. And it was an even greater honor to stand beside our President, Joe Biden, as he signed the law that finally made lynching a Federal crime. So many leaders here today made that progress possible.
Our history as a nation is born of tragedy and triumph, of struggle and success. That is who we are. And as people who love our country, as patriots, we know that we must remember and teach our full history, even when it is painful—especially when it is painful.
Today, there are those in our Nation who would prefer to erase or even rewrite the ugly parts of our past; those who attempt to teach that enslaved people benefitted from slavery; those who insult us in an attempt to gaslight us, who try to divide our Nation with unnecessary debates.
Let us not be seduced into believing that somehow we will be better if we forget. We will be better if we remember. We will be stronger if we remember. Because we all here know: It is only by understanding and learning from our past that we can continue to work together to build a better future.
And so now it is my great honor to introduce a leader who has dedicated his life to preserving and protecting our history. And Reverend Wheeler Parker, Jr., just also shared with me that he and his wife will be celebrating this weekend their fifty——
Reverend Wheeler Parker, Jr. Sixth.
Vice President Harris. ——sixth anniversary of marriage. [Laughter]
Reverend Wheeler Parker, Jr.
Rev. Parker. In fact, we were married 56 years on Sunday. My wife say, ""When we get to heaven, I'm going to say, 'Lord, not up here too.'"" [Laughter] I see we have a whole lot of amens to that. [Laughter]
I'm truly humbled by this honor. You see, I was born in Mississippi. I spent my early years as a sharecropper and was focused up on filling up a 9-foot sack—focused up on my quota, not making history. From the outhouse to the White House—[laughter]—from a time when we lived in fear to a time when President and Vice President gave us this great hope—kept their promise by delivering—this is what America means to me: promises made, promises kept.
It has been quite a journey for me from the darkness to the light. When I set with my family on the night of terror—when Emmett Till, our beloved Bobo, was taken from us, taken to be tortured and brutally murdered—back then, when I was overwhelmed with terror and fear of certain death in the darkness of a thousand midnights, in a pitch-black house on what some have called Dark Fear Road. Back then, in the darkness, I could never imagine a moment like this: standing in the light of wisdom, grace, and deliverance.
There is something amazing you feel when you meet President Biden, like I did when he signed the Emmett Till Antilynching law—Antilynching bill into law. He welcomed me into this place of great power. I felt the power of his personal devotion: his devotion to justice, to equality, his commitment to keeping the promise of America. This came from his heart, from his soul.
God bless you, President Biden, for all you have done and will do to preserve our history.
Ladies and gentlemen, please join me in recognizing President Joe Biden.
[At this point, Rev. Parker spoke briefly off-mike to the President.]
The President. I'm not going to tell you what he whispered to me. [Laughter] Thank you, Reverend Parker. And thank all of you for being here.
I want to thank Kamala for her—not only capacity to do what she does, but the fire with which she brings to the things she cares a lot about.
To all the Members of Congress, including Representative Bennie Thompson, Senator Tammy Duckworth, Representative Danny Davis, and Senator Dick Durbin, who is—we wish a speedy recovery from COVID; he's just recovering from COVID right now—and who have long fought to honor the Till family. It's not new to any of them.
To the Till family, it's an honor to be with you again.
You know, when I was preparing these remarks, I quite frankly—and my colleagues will understand this—I found myself trying to temper my anger as I was writing it. I'm not joking. I can't fathom—I can't fathom what it must have been like. It's hard to believe I was 12 years old, and I just—you know, I know no matter how much time has passed—how many birthdays, how many events, how many anniversaries—it's hard to relive this. It brings it all back.
We were talking about, Rev, as if it happened yesterday—the images in your head, and you —things you remember. But it's inspiring to see how many of your family have continued as mother's courage to find faith in pain, purpose in pain. That's a remarkable thing, it seems to me.
Insisting on an open casket for her murdered and, I might add, maimed and mutilated son. Fourteen years old. Fourteen years old. She said, ""Let the people see what I've seen."" Let the people see what I have seen.
My God, all of us who have lost children in other ways, how hard it is even to close the casket or keep it open or to—what a debate it is. But to see the child that had been maimed, and the country and the world saw—saw—not just heard the story of Emmett Till and his mother—as a story of a family's promise and loss and the Nation's reckoning with hate, violence, racism, overwhelming abuse of power, and brutality. It's hard to fathom. Hard to fathom this even in war for me. It's hard to fathom.
But today, on what we've been—would have been Emmett's 82d birthday, we add another chapter to the story of remembrance and healing. Just as we joined together when I signed the law in his name to make lynching a Federal crime—and think how long that took for that to happen—I mean—and we screened the movie ""Till"" at the White House—today we join together as I sign a proclamation designating Emmett Till and Mamie Till-Mobley National Monument in both Illinois and in Mississippi.
When we ended lynching as a matter of law, we talked about wanting to do this. But the support from the community has been so overwhelming. I thank the Members of Congress for their support and, more than that, their leadership.
At a time when there are those who seek to ban books, bury history, we're making it clear—crystal, crystal clear—[applause]—while darkness and denialism can hide much, they erase nothing. They can hide, but they erase nothing.
We can't just choose to learn what we want to know. We have to learn what we should know. We should know about our country. We should know everything: the good, the bad, the truth of who we are as a nation. That's what great nations do, and we are a great nation. That's what they do.
For only with truth comes healing, justice, repair, and another step forward toward forming a more perfect Union. We've got a hell of a long way to go.
That's what's happening. That's what's going to happen with visitors of all backgrounds to learn the history of Emmett Till and Mamie Till-Mobley through our national monument.
Look, telling the truth and the full history of our Nation is important. It's important to our children, our grandchildren, and our great-grandchildren, to our Nation as a whole.
I've said it before. It was a lesson I learned coming out of the—not like real leaders in the civil rights movement—but when I came out of the civil rights movement as a kid, as a public defender. And I used to—you know, I used to say—think that if you pass something that was good, you can make hate go away.
Hate never goes away. It just hides. It hides under the rocks. And given a little bit of oxygen by bad people, it comes roaring out again.
And it's up to all of us to deal with that, up to all of us to stop it. Up to all of us. The best way to do that is with the truth. It's used in a different context, but I think it's apply—applies here. Silence is complicity. I will not be silent, nor will you be silent about what happened.
There's really critical work ahead to continue the fight for racial justice and equality for all Americans. And my administration is committed to leading a path forward. And I know the Members of Congress here are even more committed than that.
I'm going to close with this. The reason the world saw what Mrs. Till-Mobley saw was because another hero in this story: the Black press.
Audience members. Yes!
The President. No, I'm serious. Jet Magazine, the Chicago Defender, and other newspapers and radio announcers who told the story were unflinching in the bravery with which they told that story, making sure America saw—saw—what they saw.
Ida B. Wells once said, quote, ""The way to right wrongs is to turn the light of truth upon them."" The way to right wrongs is to shine a light of truth on them. Well, that's our charge today.
By the way, parenthetically, did you ever think we'd be talking about banning books in America? Banning history? I'm serious.
To the Till family and to all of you here today, I thank you for your courage and for never giving up—never, never giving up.
And before I say even what more is on my mind, I'm now going to leave this podium. [Laughter]
No, I mean, it's just barbaric—barbaric—what happened. And seriously, all you moms out there, imagine the courage it took to say, ""Let them see."" The courage.
It's now my honor to sign this proclamation in memory of Emmett Till and Mrs. Mamie Till-Mobley.
And I thank you all for being here. And I am—I know I'm considered too much of an optimist, but I believe if we keep pushing, we're going to continue to make progress. We're going to continue to make progress. And it's already being made.
The idea that when that 14-year-old was buried, that in this Indian Treaty Room there'd be this many people of color holding powerful office, changing the direction of the country, it would have been beyond our comprehension. And we're just getting started.
The proclamation I'm signing establishes the Emmett Till and Mamie Till-Mobley National Monument.
Okay, ready?
The proclamation I'm signing establishes the Emmett Till and Mamie Till-Mobley National Monument.
[The President signed the proclamation.]

"July 21, 2023",Remarks on Artificial Intelligence,"
I'm the AI. [Laughter] If any of you think I'm Abe Lincoln, blame it on the AI.
First of all, thanks. Thanks for coming. And I want to thank my colleagues here for taking the time to come back again and again as we try to deal with the—we've joined by leaders of seven American companies who are driving innovation in artificial intelligence. And it is astounding.
Artificial intelligence or—it promises an enormous—an enormous—promise of both risk to our society and our economy and our national security, but also incredible opportunities—incredible opportunities.
Just 2 months ago, Kamala and I met with these leaders—most of them are here again—to underscore the responsibility in making sure that products that they are producing are safe and making them public—what they are and what they aren't. Since then, I've met with some of America's top minds in technology to hear the range of perspectives and possibilities and risk of AI.
Kamala can't be here because she's traveling to Florida, but she's met with civil society leaders to hear their concerns about the impacts on society and ways to protect the rights of Americans.
Over the past year, my administration has taken action to guide responsible innovation. Last October, we introduced the first-of-its-kind AI Bill of Rights. In February, I signed an Executive order to direct agencies to protect the public from algorithms that discriminate. In May, we unveiled a new strategy to establish seven new AI research institutes to help drive breakthroughs in responsible AI innovention [innovation; White House correction].
And today I'm pleased to announce that these seven companies have agreed to voluntary commitments for responsible innovation. These commitments, which the companies will implement immediately, underscore three fundamental principles: safety, security, and trust.
First, the companies have an obligation to make sure their technology is safe before releasing it to the public. That means testing the capabilities of their systems, assessing their potential risk, and making the results of these assessments public.
Second, companies must prioritize the security of their systems by safeguarding their models against cyber threats and managing the risks to our national security and sharing the best practices and industry standards that are necessary.
Third, the companies have a duty to earn the people's trust and empower users to make informed decisions: labeling content that has been altered or AI-generated, rooting out bias and discrimination, strengthening privacy protections, and shielding children from harm.
And finally, companies have agreed to find ways for AI to help meet society's greatest challenges—from cancer to climate change—and invest in education and new jobs to help students and workers prosper from the opportunities, and there are enormous opportunities of AI.
These commitments are real, and they're concrete. They're going to help fulfill—the industry fulfill its fundamental obligation to Americans to develop safe, secure, and trustworthy technologies that benefit society and uphold our values and our shared values.
Let me close with this. We'll see more technology change in the next 10 years, or even in the next few years, than we've seen in the last 50 years. That has been an astounding revelation to me, quite frankly. Artificial intelligence is going to transform the lives of people around the world.
The group here will be critical in shepherding that innovation with responsibility and safety by design to earn the trust of Americans. And quite frankly, as I met with world leaders, all——all our—all the G-7 is focusing on the same thing.
Social media has shown us the harm that powerful technology can do without the right safeguards in place. And I've said at the State of the Union that Congress needs to pass bipartisan legislation to impose strict limits on personal data collection, ban targeted advertisements to kids, require companies to put health and safety first.
But we must be clear eyed and vigilant about the threats emerging—of emerging technologies that can pose—don't have to, but can pose—to our democracy and our values. Americans are seeing how advanced artificial intelligence and the pace of innovation have the power to disrupt jobs and industries.
These commitments are a promising step, but the—we have a lot more work to do together. Realizing the promise of AI by managing the risk is going to require some new laws, regulations, and oversight.
In the weeks ahead, I'm going to continue to take executive action to help America lead the way toward responsible innovation. And we're going to work with both parties to develop appropriate legislation and regulation. I'm pleased that Leader Schumer and Leader Jeffries and others in the Congress are making this a top bipartisan priority.
As we advance the agenda here at home, we'll lead the work with—we'll lead work with our allies and partners on a common international framework to govern the development of AI.
I think these leaders and—I thank these leaders that are in the room with me today——
[At this point, the President cleared his throat.]
——and their partnership—excuse me—and their commitments that they're making. This is a serious responsibility, and we have to get it right. And there's enormous, enormous potential upside as well.
So I want to thank you all. And they're about to go down to a meeting, which I'll catch up with them later.
So thank you, thank you, thank you.
Q. Mr. President, can you tell us about the hacking of Cabinet officials by China and the threshold of concern you have about that sir?

"July 20, 2023","Remarks on the National Economy in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania","
Hello, Philly! Have a seat if you have one.
Emily, thank you for that introduction.
I tell you what, Mayor Kenney, thanks for the passport back into the city. I think the only reason that allows that to happen is, I married a Philly girl.
You know, they can't be here today. but I want to thank Governor Shapiro, who's doing a hell of a job, and to my friends Senator Bobby Casey and Senator Fetterman, who have been such great partners to me.
Folks, I want to also thank Representative Mary Gay Scanlon, who fights so hard for this district, and the other Members of Congress, Brendan Boyle, Chrissy Houlahan, Madeleine Dean, Joe Courtney. I tell you, the—oh, Donald Norcross, by the way. Donald from across the way.
You know, I always kid Donald when, mayor—Mr. Mayor, I say, you know, Delaware is small, so we have to fight for every inch of territory. So there was a debate on whether or not—whether Delaware—the State of Delaware owned the Delaware River along the Delaware shore up to the highwater mark in New Jersey.
And they said, ""No."" We went to the Supreme Court, and they got something right. They said, yes, we do. Anyway—[laughter]. I always kid them all the time.
Flooding in Bucks County, Pennsylvania 
Folks, look, before I begin, I want to say we're praying for those who lost their lives in the flooding in Bucks County. The idea that there's not global warming, I think, can't be denied by anybody anymore. And—at any rate.
We're grateful to all the first responders continuing to look for 2-year-old Mattie and her baby brother Conrad. With the grace of God, maybe something will come of it.
I want to thank Governor Shapiro and all the Bucks County officials and their leadership during that tragic time. We provided all we could from FEMA, but there's a lot to be done.
National Economy 
I'm here today to talk about what we're doing to invest in America, invest in Pennsylvania, invest in our clean energy future—and to talk about the progress we've made building an economy from the middle out and the bottom up.
You know, I came to office determined to strengthen the middle class. I often say—and I mean it sincerely—you know, Wall Street—good folks down there, but they didn't build the middle class, they didn't build America. The middle class was built by the middle class, and unions build the middle class, and it changed the economic direction of this country.
Because we have a—I got tired of trickle-down economics. I've never been a big fan. If the wealthy do very well—I'm a capitalist. I like the wealthy to be able to be wealthy. But if they—the mere fact they do well doesn't mean that everybody else does well.
I watched my dad growing up. There was not a whole lot of benefit trickled down on his kitchen table as a consequence of trickle-down economics to what everyone from the Financial Times to the Wall Street Journal has become my change—my—a different philosophy. They—I don't think they started off trying to be complimentary, but they started calling it ""Bidenomics.""
And our plan is working—Bidenomics. We're here—[applause]. And here's what it looks like. Over 13 million new jobs built across the country and nearly half a million of them here in Pennsylvania just in the last 2½ years. Eight hundred thousand manufacturing jobs, twenty-eight thousand here in Pennsylvania alone in the last 2½ years.
That's more jobs in 2 years than any President has created in a 4-year term. Unemployment is below 4 percent—the longest stretch of unemployment below 4 percent in the last 50 years. We're beginning to come back, folks. We can because we're giving workers a chance.
Unemployment is down. But to the surprise of a lot of economists, so is inflation. Remember the story? In order for inflation to come down, you've got to cut wages for hard-working folks, you've got to have unemployment up in order for inflation to come down.
Well, guess what? I never bought that. I don't think the problem in America is that too many people are working or that people are making too much money. Instead, we've focused on getting Americans into the workforce by fixing a broken supply chain, lowering the cost of product from everything from health care to the products we purchase.
The fact is, companies made record-high profits during the pandemic. And by the way, I'm not opposed to the companies. I come from the corporate capital of the world. [Laughter] More corporations are incorporated in Delaware than every other State in the Union. But everybody should pay their fair share. Everybody should pay their fair share.
Now they're coming down, and so is inflation. We need to keep bringing it down—markups and the margins of their profits. It's one thing to make a profit; it's another thing to be excessive. You know, this is one of the most important ways to continue to make progress on inflation.
While we have to do more, inflation has slowed every single month in the last 12—on a yearly basis for the last 12 months. How many times did you read that inflation—that a recession is coming? They even—in the Wall Street—today said they don't see a recession coming now.
It's the lowest point—inflation—the lowest point in over 2 years. The U.S. has the lowest inflation rate of any major economy in the world, the so-called G-7. It's less than two-thirds of what it was a year ago, down from 9 percent to 3 percent and going to go down lower.
At the same time, pay for low-wage workers has gone up at a faster pace in over two decades. Wages are growing faster than inflation. That means a lot of working folks are beginning to be able to have a little—just a little bit of breathing room.
According to the surveys, job satisfaction in America is at a 36-year high. We've got more work to do, but people are coming off the sidelines to work.
The share of working-age Americans in the workforce is as high as it's been in 20 years, including during every single day under my predecessor. And, folks, it's not an accident; it's my economic plan in action. It's Bidenomics.
Since I took office, we've attracted over half a trillion dollars—a half a trillion dollars—in private investment in American manufacturing and clean energy. That's what's been attracted to engage in these issues.
Instead of exporting jobs—it used to be: find the cheapest market in the world, send the job overseas, and bring the product back. Not on my watch. Right here—what we're doing, we're creating jobs in America, and we're exporting American products.
With the leadership of your Democratic Members of Congress, we passed the Inflation Reduction Act—although a few Republicans did support it—the largest investment to combat climate ever—ever—anywhere in the world. All of $368 billion.
We know the urgency. I don't hear many naysayers on climate deny the floods, the heatwaves, the wildfire smoke impacting so many Americans just this week alone. It's just spontaneous.
But we also have solutions. A lot of my friends in organized labor know: When I think climate, I think jobs. I think union jobs. Not a joke. Not a joke.
And this law is creating millions of good-paying clean energy manufacturing jobs, including offshore wind.
When I took office, I set a goal of producing 30 gigawatts of offshore energy wind by 2030. Thirty gigawatts is enough to power 10 million homes, and it will help put us on a path to 100-percent clean energy [electricity; White House correction] by 2035. By 2035, all of electricity—you turn on any—is all going to be clean energy.
It's not hypothetical. Construction is already underway in two major projects on—off the East Coast. And just within the last month, the Department of Interior advanced permitting on two more wind projects on the East Coast.
And here in the Philly Shipyard, Great Lakes Dredge and Dock is also stepping up to help meet the clean energy goals. Here today, workers in nine different unions will start building a vessel called the Acadia. It's going to place heavy rocks at the base of the offshore wind projects to stabilize them when they put these down, and it's going to project—protect it against erosion.
It will be the first vessel of its kind that's made in America—American owned, American operated. And the rocks will come from American quarries, and it will be loaded at American ports.
Steel for a vessel is being made by the United Steelworkers in Indiana. The engine will be made by the United States Electrical, Radio, and Machine Workers in Pittsburgh. The crew is going to be American marine—mariners from Seafarers International Union.
The turbines themselves will be as tall as the buildings in Center City, Philadelphia. That's how big they are. And the blades: 110 yards long. I went to see them being made in Colorado. It's breathtaking. And I might add, notwithstanding what the other guy said, windmills do not cause cancer. [Laughter]
Look, some folks may not know there was a law in 1920 called the Jones Act that was passed. It says ships traveling between U.S. ports have to be American built, American owned, and have American crews. But there are some content to rely on ships built overseas without American crews to operate them. Again, not on my watch.
We're strengthening the American shipbuilding, supporting good union jobs, and bringing offshore wind supply chains back home. Before the pandemic, ""supply chain"" wasn't a phrase that most Americans ever thought about. But today, after delays in parts and products, everybody knows what a supply chain means and why they matter.
Our ""Investing in America"" agenda is bringing our clean energy supply chains home. Since I took office, we've seen more than $16 billion in new offshore wind investments, including 18 offshore wind vessels, 12 manufacturing facilities, and 13 ports.
Today we announced the first-ever offshore wind sale in the Gulf of Mexico. We're going to the Gulf. You think I'm kidding. [Laughter] Ain't seen nothing yet. Across the Delaware River in Paulsboro, New Jersey, workers are welding the steel foundation for another large-scale wind project. That's going to create more than 3,000 good-paying jobs.
A project off the coast of New York will use a vessel built in the shipyards of Louisiana, Mississippi, and Florida and rely on an electrical substations engineered in Kansas and made in Texas.
The Inflation Reduction Act offers tax credits for projects using American-made iron, steel, manufactured products so our clean energy future will be made in America. I mean it. And all this investment—you know it better than any group of people I could be talking to—all this investment means good-paying jobs here at home—here at home.
We're making sure these new jobs come free and fair and the ability to join a union if you're not already in a union. I made a commitment that I'd be the most prounion President in American history, and I'm keeping that promise.
Let me explain why. I met with the Business Roundtable, the leading businessmen in the Nation. And they asked me, ""Why?"" I said, ""Because it's good for you."" I tell businesses all the time: Union workers are the best in the world. You don't just say: ""By the way, I want to be an electrician. Here's my license.""
The young woman I just—you just heard, she's not an electrician, but guess what? Four to 5 years of apprenticeship. It's like going back to school. It's like going to college for 4 years. You do the job right. They do it on time. And long term, it costs less than nonunion labor.
And here at the Philly Shipyard, over a thousand union workers will be employed onsite like metalworkers, boilermakers, electricians. In fact, this shipyard runs an apprenticeship program giving workers the skills to do these jobs. They can earn up to $100,000 a year, and you don't need a college degree.
Just a few years ago, this shipyard was down to a handful of workers—because these guys know I've been coming here for a long, long time—since 1973—when it was the Navy Shipyard. And a lot of us wondered whether it would still be here, didn't we? A lot of us wondered 15, 10, 12 years ago. Well, let me tell you: It's coming alive again.
Just this week my administration completed a review for a potential wind project off the coast of Rhode Island and Connecticut. It's part of the national project labor agreement with the building trades. And I want to thank the AFL-CIO President Liz Shuler for personally getting that done.
Together, we're transforming the country not just through manufacturing, but also rebuilding our infrastructure. We need to have the best infrastructure in the world if we're going to lead the world. We used to be number one. We now rank number 13 in the world in highways, bridges—how can we be number one in the world economically?
You can't have the best economy without having the best infrastructure. So the bipartisan infrastructure law, which a number of our colleagues did vote for on both sides of the aisle—I've already announced 35,000 projects in 4,500 communities all across America, proving we can do big things.
By the way, right here, in Philly, we're going to build billion-dollar tunnels underneath the water as you go from Amtrak station heading north. It's going to increase the speeds of trains. They'll be able to go through it 100 miles an hour instead of 30.
And guess what? When you get to point A to point B and you can do it on rail and leave your car home, people leave their cars home. It saves money, saves the environment.
There's no better example than here in Philadelphia: A tanker truck crashed and closed a key stretch of I-95 last month. You remember that. A hundred and fifty thousand vehicles cross that part of the highway—a hundred and fifty thousand—every single day. With the leadership of Governor Shapiro, Casey, Fetterman, Boyle, Kenney, it opened in less than 2 weeks. Do you hear that? Two weeks. Congratulations, Mr. Mayor.
I mean, think about it. All kidding aside. When I was—we were saying that on the—when—on the bridge, people were looking at us like: ""Oh, God. Here they go again."" It's a record time. And guess what? It used materials from right here in Pennsylvania—all that crushed glass, all that base—I mean—and it was done with union work.
Also announced $78 million for safety improvements along Roosevelt Boulevard here in Philly, from North Broad to the Bucks County line. Between 2012 and 2021, accidents along that stretch of highway killed 119 people and I don't know how many injured. A hundred and nineteen died.
Nearly one in three Philadelphians lives within a mile of there, meaning thousands of families will benefit when we make that a hell of a lot safer.
Removing every single lead pipe in America, including an estimated 20,000 lead pipe lines here in Philadelphia and thousands—and thousands of lead pipes in school fountains all across America, including here in Philadelphia. They're a risk to everyone's health, especially our children.
We're making investments like this in communities all across the country, in red States, blue States. It doesn't matter; I'm President for everybody. And I said that no matter whether they voted for me or against me, I would make sure we changed this.
You can see exactly where this money is going if you're interested. Go to—online, go to invest.gov, and find out what's happening in your community, because that you know, we talked remember ""Infrastructure Week""? [Laughter] Well, we have ""Infrastructure Decade.""
And guess what? It's committed 1 trillion 300 billion dollars. And guess what else? I lowered the Federal deficit by 1 trillion 700 billion dollars in the first 2 years. You can do both.
You know, the reason I'm saying this is, we've operated on principles that aren't—having been working.
My ""Invest in America"" agenda also had another transformative impact. All those Members of Congress who voted against the bill suddenly realized it's pretty good. And they're bragging about it. [Laughter] I found it interesting.
As you may have seen—apparently 40 million people watched—Marjorie Taylor Greene, the very conservative gentlelady from the State of Georgia, said, ""Biden is doing things like Roosevelt,"" and it goes on the line as if it—""creating these jobs, and he thinks that""—I thought that was—I've never had an endorsement from her before. [Laughter]
But all kidding aside, every Republican—every single Republican—voted against the Inflation Reduction Act. And now many are trying to repeal. You know, and it was—in order—the whole reason for the act was to repeal the clean energy provisions. That's why they voted ""no."" But it didn't stop them from claiming credit now that billions of dollars and thousands of jobs are coming to their States.
And then there's the distinguished Senator from Alabama, a former coach of a winning football team at University of Alabama: Senator Tuberville—you know, the one who's blocking the nominations of America's finest military leaders, jeopardizing our national security over domestic social issues.
Well, he's also strongly opposed to the bipartisan infrastructure law. And now—I listened to him on television. He voted against it, and here's what he says now: ""Great to see Alabama receive critical funds to boost ongoing broadband efforts.""
I thought he thought it was a bad idea to invest in that. But now it's coming to Alabama, and hot damn, boy, it's a good thing. Look, I'm glad the Senator is coming around on the infrastructure law, but I'm not going to let up until he comes around on the critical military nominations as well.
Let me close with this. I'm not here to declare victory; we've got a long way to go on the economy. But I'm here to say we have more work to do. We have a plan that's turning things around pretty quickly. ""Bidenomics"" is just another way of saying ""Restore the American Dream."" Forty years of trickle-down economics in Democrat and Republican administrations limited the dream to those at the top.
But I believe every American willing to work hard should be able to get a job no matter where they live—in the heartland, in a small town, in big cities—to raise their kids on a good paycheck and keep roofs overhead with a—where they grew up, be able to stay there.
My dad used to have an expression, and I swear to God, this was the expression, as kids growing up. He'd and this was how he'd say it. He'd say: ""Joey, a job is about a lot more than a paycheck. It's about your dignity. It's about your dignity. It's about respect. It's about being able to look your kid in the eye and say, 'Honey, it's going to be okay.'"" And he meant it.
He never got to go to college, but he meant it. He worked like hell. Jobs are about dignity. That's the American Dream. That's Bidenomics.
It's rooted in what always worked best for this country: investing in America, investing in Americans. Because when you invest in our people, you strengthen the middle class, we see stronger economic growth that benefits everybody. The rich still do very well, and they should be able to do well.
When I-95 shut down last month, nobody thought we'd have it back open in less than 2 weeks. But with American ingenuity, American workers, we proved everybody wrong. I don't know about you, but it filled me with pride about what we can do when we work together. And we worked together on that project.
The same will be true here in Philly Shipyard and with the clean energy future we're building all across America. It will be transformational.
And for thousands of families who rely on good jobs for their project—these projects create, it means restoring a sense of pride, a sense of hope, a sense of dignity that got lost somewhere along the way.
For the longest time, we've been told to give up on manufacturing in America. How many times have you heard or read in the paper the last 25 years we can never lead the world in manufacturing again? Well, we are, and we will. We'll never believe that. I've never believed it, and I don't think most of you did.
This Nation used to lead the world in manufacturing. And we're going to do it again.
I know the people of this country. And I can say honestly: I have never been more optimistic about America's future than I am this very day. I swear to God. I've long said to other world leaders—and I know almost every one of them personally, met them—it's never been a good bet to bet against America. It's never, never, never.
We just have to remember who we are. We're the United States of America. And there is nothing—nothing beyond our capacity if we work together.
So God bless you all, and may God protect our troops.
This is a new day. We're going to—more work to do. We're going to get it done.
Thank you.

"July 19, 2023",Remarks in a Meeting of the White House Competition Council,"
Please, stay seated. Stay seated. Thank you. Hello, everybody. Good afternoon.
The reason we're late: It's all my fault. I know that's a shock. But I must tell you, I couldn't resist. Two of the—the children of a man and a woman who got me started in—back in 1972—it was actually 1970—were in town, and I showed them the office. And I apologize for keeping you waiting. I really am.
Look, this Competition Council is an important part of Bidenomics, my plan to build an economy from the middle out and the bottom up. And I think it's working. I think it's working.
For example, over the past year, we've seen a dramatic decline in inflation. It dropped by two-thirds—down to 3 percent—at a time when unemployment has been below 4 percent for the longest stretch in 50 years. I've rejected the notion that the reason for inflation is—the only way you get inflation down is reduce employment and/or reduce wages.
Remember, the experts said: To get inflation under control, we need to lower those wages and drive up unemployment. But I've never bought that. I don't think the problem in America today is too many people working or working people are making too much money.
Instead, we focused on getting America into the workforce—Americans into the workforce by fixing a broken supply chains and lowering costs. The fact is, companies made record-high profits during the pandemic. And now those costs are coming down and so is inflation. We need to keep bringing down the mark-ups and their margins and continue making progress on inflation.
And promoting competition helps lower cost as well.
Now, I've said this before: I'm a capitalist, but I have no problem with companies making reasonable profits. But it's got to be a fair competition for that to occur.
Before I took office, more than three-quarters of the American industries had become more concentrated than they are—than they were before. Often, just a handful of companies dominate the marketplace. Bidenomics is about increasing competition, not stifling competition. When companies have to compete, it means lower prices, fairer wages, and more innovation.
That's why, 2 years ago, I signed an Executive order to create this Council to increase competition and lower costs for American households.
For example, we made hearing aids available over the counter for as little as $200 a pair, instead of thousands of dollars, and capped the price of insulin at $35 on—those on Medicare, and thus saving folks hundreds of thousands of dollars over time.
You know, we aim to we're taking aim at noncompete clauses, which prevent 30 million Americans—from security guards to retail workers—from getting jobs in the same field. And there's no rationale for that. It's not like they have trade secrets.
And we're cracking down on junk fees across industries, including banking, concert, airlines, and junk health insurance plans. Folks are tired of being played for suckers. They're just tired of being played for suckers. And it's about basic fairness.
Today we're taking more action.
First, the Department of Agriculture—and you'll hear from the Secretary in a moment—together with bipartisan attorneys general in 31 States and the District of Columbia are ramping up enforcement of antitrust and consumer protection laws in food and in agriculture.
For example, just four supermarket companies control over a third—a third—of the market nationwide. And it's even more concentrated at the local level, where consumers have been—have had even fewer stores to choose from. Groceries in consolidated markets will charge you more because you have nowhere else to shop.
Now the Department of Agriculture and partners in the States are going to make large corporations—making sure they cannot artificially raise food prices through price fixing and price gouging.
Second, we're cracking down on hidden junk fees in rental housing. Folks at home know having to pay $100 or more just to fill out a rental application, even though the credit check can cost as little as $20. The application fees can be a profit center for landlords.
Some accept applications from hundreds of potential tenants, far more than they could seriously consider renting to, just to collect these fees. And then some charge surprise fees just to pay your rent online or fees for services that should be included in rent, like mail sorting and pest control. It's simply not right, and we're going to move on it.
Now several real estate companies serving tens of millions of renters, including Zillow, apartments.com, affordablehousing.com—they have joined us to take action against these junk fees. They're updating their websites to show renters all the hidden fees up front so you can know the full cost before they sign a lease.
Third, this morning, the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission released their new Merger Guidelines. Anticompetitive mergers can hurt people and drive up costs as well.
For example, hospital mergers have led to price increases of 20 percent or more. Health insurance mergers have caused premiums to go up 7 percent on average. All told, this kind of industry concentration costs the typical American household an estimated $5,000 a year.
And I've said when I signed the Executive order, we cannot accept bad mergers that lead to mass layoffs, higher prices, and fewer options for workers and consumers.
I'll close with this: To get this meeting started, I've said before: Capitalism—I've said before, capitalism without competition isn't capitalism; it's exploitation. And I'm grateful to this Competition Council as we keep building on this momentum to reduce cost and deliver more results for the American people.
With that, I'm going to turn it over to Secretary Vilsack. Mr. Secretary.

"July 19, 2023",Remarks at the Congressional Picnic,"
The President. Hello, everybody!
Every time I hear ""Hail to the Chief,"" I turn around and say, ""Where is he?"" [Laughter] I'm getting used to it, though.
Folks, thanks for being here. Welcome to your house. And you're the way—oh, you think I'm kidding? I know who—I know who owns this place.
[At this point, a pigeon flew in front of the podium.]
Thank you—that bird, right there. That—that pigeon. [Laughter]
Folks, first of all, let me begin by thanking all our families. I think we underestimate sometimes—hey, Tommy. How are you?
I think we underestimate sometimes how much pressure is put on the family—our kids, our grandkids, our spouses, our parents. And I want to thank you. And that's why this is really not for the Members of Congress; this is for all of their families. That's what this is all about. So thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.
And, folks, look, I want to—a special welcome to Speaker Emeritus—and she's—she's going to be my Speaker her whole life, I think—my whole life. And I want to thank Nancy and her—and——
The First Lady. Oh, she's right there.
The President. Where——
The First Lady. There.
The President. There you are—well, she's hiding behind that big guy. You know what I mean? And her grandsons and—Leader Schumer and his wife and his daughter-in-law. And, by the way, he has a grandson. Now he—now that we know who—if we want to get anything done, we can go to his grandson. He's only 5 years old, and we can get it done.
And, folks, also, I want to thank Leader Jeffries. He's—the reason I like him so much—he's got a—he's got a backbone like a ramrod and he's got great integrity.
And Speaker McCarthy, who—I don't want to hurt his reputation, but I actually like him. [Laughter] And I'm sorry, I didn't want to hurt you. But all kidding aside, we've been able to work together, and I appreciate it very much.
And I don't know whether Dick Durbin is here. He was supposed to be coming down, as well Whip Clark. I'm not sure she's here as well. But any rate——
Audience member. Right here.
The President. There you are. Okay. We're all set then.
Look, folks, you know, Jill and I especially want to thank you and all the families for coming. I hope you have a good time. This is—nothing formal about this.
This is your house. This is the people's house. This is a night that—my favorite picture—I was—I'll end with this. My favorite picture that I—we have in this residence as well as home is when our boys were 7 and 8 years old at one of the congressional picnics. And they're standing way down there, and they're both looking at the monument and the White House is in the background. It's my favorite picture of all time.
And I just want you to know: I hope you enjoy the night, and I hope you are able to spend some time with one another as well. You don't get a lot of opportunity to do that.
And it reminds me of the work that we have to do. You know, for all the disagreements we have, we've got to remember: At the end of the day, we're friends. That's how it's always been. We've got to be friends, good to each other. And I—no, I mean it. And I think we're getting there.
So I want to thank you all very much for coming. I'm not going to say anything more.
You want to say anything, Madam Vice President?
Vice President Kamala D. Harris. Thank you, all. Your role of leadership, the sacrifice that the families make really does make a difference in terms of the good work that we do together for the sake of our country.
So I thank you all for what you do every day.
The President. God bless America. Let's get going.

"July 18, 2023",Remarks Prior to a Meeting With President Isaac Herzog of Israel and an Exchange With Reporters,"
President Biden. Well, Mr. President, welcome back. Welcome back to Washington. Welcome back to the White House, and it's a pleasure to have you.
And you know, we were together in Israel, and we're together again today. We've got a lot to talk about.
And I—you know my love for Israel is deep rooted and long lasting. And as I—as I've often said: If there wasn't an Israel, we'd have to invent one. And—but 75 years.
President Herzog. It's amazing.
President Biden. Seventy-five years. It's hard to believe. Hard to believe I even remember about two-thirds of those. [Laughter]
And this is a friendship, I believe, that's just simply unbreakable. Unbreakable. And together, working to bring more stability and integration in the Middle East. And a lot of hard work. We've got a lot more to do, but there's progress.
Last year, we convened the largest gathering of Arabs and Israelis in a decade at the Negev Forum. And we resolved the maritime boundary dispute between Israel and Lebanon, which people thought could never happen. We opened up an airspace for Israel in—over Saudi Arabia and Oman after I had a little visit there. And we brought Israelis and Palestinians together at a political level on the—in—at the—in Aqaba and El Sharm.
President Herzog. Yes.
President Biden. And as I affirmed to Prime Minister Netanyahu yesterday, America's commitment to Israel is firm, and it is ironclad. And we're committed, as well, to ensure that Iran never acquires a nuclear weapon.
So we've got a lot to talk about. But, again, welcome.
President Herzog. Thank you, Mr. President. It's wonderful to see you again.
I bring a message of greeting and gratitude on behalf of the people of Israel, the entire nation of Israel, from all sides of the political spectrum, all expressing great friendship and gratitude to you.
As you said, from—it's almost a jubilee—[laughter]—since you entered politics. And you've always stood by the State of Israel and the people of Israel in so many issues.
And I was pleased to hear about your conversation with Prime Minister Netanyahu, in which you focused on our ironclad military and security cooperation, because there are some enemies of ours that sometimes mistaken the fact that we may have some differences as impacting our unbreakable bond. And I truly believe that had they known how much our cooperation has grown in recent years—and it's achieved new heights—they would not think that way.
I also want to thank you, Mr. President, for pursuing more and more cooperation and integration in the region, for finding and looking for further partners for peace with Israel, and for cooperating on so many regional issues together.
And finally, Mr. President, I know you have mentioned, and you—we will discuss that as well, the internal Israeli situation.
As you know, I'm here, and I'm happy to be here because tomorrow I will be speaking in front of a Joint Session of Congress especially devoted to celebrating Israel's 75th independence. However, of course, my heart and soul is also in Israel in the heated debate which we are going through as a society. It's a heated debate, but it is also a virtue and a tribute to the greatness of Israeli democracy.
And let me reiterate clear—crystal clear: Israeli democracy is sound, strong, and resilient. We are going through pains. We are going through heated debates. We are going through challenging moments. But I true believe—truly believe—and I will say to you, Mr. President, as I've said it as head of state to the people of Israel: We should always seek to find amicable consensus. And I agree with you on that as well.
I'm pursuing it, even in these very moments, for my people, as much as we can, in order to find solutions and exit out of this crisis properly.
Thank you, Mr. President, for your friendship. And God bless you.
President Biden. Thank you for your friendship. And we've got a lot to talk about. Thank you all very much.

"July 13, 2023","Remarks Prior to a Meeting With President Sauli Niinistö of Finland in Helsinki, Finland","
President Niinistö. So, Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen, it's a great pleasure to wish you welcome to Finland. And I continue by thanking you for your strong support and your strong will to support us during the time that Finland has entered to a new era in our security policy.
And I have to tell you that this week in Vilnius was very impressive to experience the way you created unity amongst the allies. That was great to see.
President Biden. Thank you.
President Niinistö. So, once again, I warmly welcome you, and I guess you got the best welcomes already on the streets of Helsinki—[laughter]—which are—[inaudible].
President Biden. By the way, they are. They're very—very gracious. Very gracious.
Well, it's a delight to be here. It's good to be back in Finland. This is my second visit. And it's—you know, I remember a conversation you and I had when you called to come to the White House to talk about being a member——
President Niinistö. Yes.
President Biden. ——of NATO. And it took me about 3 seconds to say, ""Yes."" Strong support.
President Niinistö. Yes. [Laughter]
President Biden. No, I mean it sincerely, because we had—we launched your ratification process—the fastest it's occurred in modern history. The fastest ratification period occurring in modern history.
You may remember my telling you, I said to our friend in the east that he wants the Finlandization of NATO; well, you're going to get the NATO-ization of Finland. [Laughter]
But all kidding aside, you know, you're—you've been a great partner. We're great allies. And you know, Finland and the United States, I think we're stronger together. And I really mean that. You've been an incredible asset to NATO and to the world.
The—and the main reason is, we have the same value set. I really mean that. It really matters. And you know, we're deepening our defense cooperation to ensure that—the security of our people as we modernize the—your air force with the F-35 aircraft, which you already had.
And together, we're standing for shared democratic values. That's what it's all about. I really think—and you're very gracious and kind to give me credit for unity at NATO. But I think it's—I've been doing this a long time; I don't think NATO has ever been stronger.
President Niinistö. You could sense a feeling of that.
President Biden. No, I believe that.
President Niinistö. Yes.
President Biden. And we had a very, very—I had a very good, long meeting with Zelenskyy, who ended up being very happy, and met with his military people.
And I think there's a—I—it's a different era in the nature of our relationship and bringing along Sweden as well. It makes a gigantic difference.
So I'm anxious to continue to work with you.
President Niinistö. It seems that when things get serious, also people understand that we have to stick together.
President Biden. And you putting together this U.S.-Nordic Summit means a lot to me as well, so I'm looking forward to meeting our colleagues. But I want to thank you. I mean, you've been an incredible, incredible partner.

"July 13, 2023","Remarks at the United States-Nordic Leaders Summit in Helsinki, Finland","
President Sauli Niinistö of Finland. Mr. President, dear Joe, you're most welcome to this Nordic family meeting.
President Biden. Good to be back.
President Niinistö. You know all of us, and we know you. We have understood and heard you referring many times on discussions so—by you and President Obama, and saying that if the whole world would be like Nordics, we wouldn't have that many problems.
President Biden. That's almost exactly what he would say. ""If we left the important decisions to the Nordics, we'd all be in good shape.""
President Niinistö. Oh, it's even better. [Laughter] Let's—this afternoon we try to be the worthy of that, by your assistance.
I think we have on the table only one issue, that is guarantee the future: security-wise, environmental-wise, and technology-wise.
So why don't we get started, please.
President Biden. Well, friends, it's good to be here with all of you. It's good to be back in Finland and——
[At this point, President Biden adjusted his microphone.]
There you go. It's good to be back in Finland and with all of you. And Barack wasn't very far off.
And we just finished a historic NATO summit—and I think it was historic—where we welcomed Finland's accession to NATO and reached an agreement to move forward on Sweden's membership in NATO. And it was a reminder that the nations around the table are—not only share a common history, but we share common challenges and—I would add, presumptuously—common values.
And you know, the vision for the world that we all share—and I think it's a very similar vision—is one that's more free, more secure, and opportunities made available for all. Because we know that when other countries do well, particularly those countries who are struggling, we all do better. We all do better.
And we're working in lockstep on—to tackle climate crisis, which you've been leaders on for a long time, and—in order to literally preserve our planet. It's the only existential threat humanity faces, and we don't have a lot of time. But I'm confident if we continue to work together, we can deal with it.
And we're pioneering the next generation of technologies, and that's going to power everyone's economies. And I think we have to even—we have to continue to remain very close on coordinating. Because it can be a great, great advantage for humanity, but it could also cause some great difficulties in artificial intelligence and other things if we don't cooperate and know what is going on.
And together, we're standing with the brave people of Ukraine as they defend themselves against Russia's brutal assault.
So today I look forward to discussing these and many other issues. And generally, it's an honor to be with you all. It's an honor to be with you. Thank you.
Prime Minister Katrin Jakobsdóttir of Iceland. Well, thank you, Sauli, for organizing this meeting. And thank you, Joe, for being with us, your Nordic friends, here today.
I think it's actually very meaningful for all of us just arriving from Vilnius, the NATO summit. And we can continue our discussions on security, but also talk about the other generational challenges we are all facing—the climate and the biodiversity crisis, if I may mention that.
President Biden. Yes.
Prime Minister Jakobsdóttir. And I must say that the U.S. obviously has a very important role to play there. And we definitely want to do our bit there.
Artificial intelligence—and I agree—it is really the responsibility of our societies to ensure that it will benefit all of us because it can also have a detrimental effect. And I would also like to mention societal resilience, which is a theme we often talk about here at our Nordic meetings, and I think we can actually, well, you know, learn a lot from each other when it comes to those issues.
So I value this opportunity very much and look forward to our discussions.
Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen of Denmark. Well, first of all, thank you for—for hosting us today, and good to see you in the Nordic part of the world, President Biden. I think was—our meeting in NATO in Vilnius was very successful. It's a stronger alliance now after we left the meeting than before.
And I think we have to salute you, because it was a brave decision, just after the war started, to gather with Sweden to walk in our direction in NATO. And now you have become a member, and we are so happy that we will soon be able to welcome Sweden as well.
And of course, this means something for the Nordic region, because we have been together in so many areas through the years, but we have never been together in NATO before. So this also brings us some possibilities and opportunities in the Nordic region.
You said before that we have been frontrunners on the green transition, but it's you who have brought U.S. back on the green agenda, fighting climate change.
And I think one of the areas where we can work even closer together, U.S. and the Nordic, are the idea of not only ensuring that we will combat climate change, but at the same time, we have to create jobs for ordinary people.
President Biden. Yes.
Prime Minister Frederiksen. So—and this is the Nordic way of doing things, that we always think holistic. So not just solving a crisis or solving a problem, but creating a better future for more people.
And with you as President in the White House, we have a possibility to do it together.
So thanks again for inviting us. It's fantastic to be here.
Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre of Norway. I will follow up on my colleagues and for you, President Biden, to be with the Nordics, as we said in Vilnius, this is the first time in modern times. Historians will discuss whether you have to go back to the 14th century to see us around the same table. [Laughter]
Prime Minister Frederiksen. [Inaudible]
Prime Minister Støre. Well—we've——
Prime Minister Frederiksen. And we decided that.
Prime Minister Støre. Yes. [Laughter] We were very young then.
But nonetheless, it is historic. And I don't think this is a time for looking back; it's really time to see what will this mean. I think it will be a stronger Nordic voice in NATO. It will make us more secure and NATO stronger, as a strong alliance.
And I'll pick up on what Mette is saying. I remember, President Biden, in the campaign, you said that ""I'm a union man."" And I think when we do work on the environment and the big energy transition, we really have to look after jobs and welfare. Because if this is going to be a detriment for jobs and welfare, we will not succeed.
And I take it that we are likeminded on this. And we have to be preparing for climate conferences this fall, for new moments coming. And I think this discussion here will also give us some inspiration for that.
In addition, when we will now start planning our security and national defense, we will do so for the first time with what we call interoperability in the northern region. And that is a significant improvement.
Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson of Sweden. First, Sauli, thanks very much for hosting us again in this beautiful place. The last time was together with President Zelenskyy. Thank you so much.
And, Mr. President, thanks for joining us and——
President Biden. [Inaudible]
Prime Minister Kristersson. [Laughter] Thanks for joining us anyway. And thanks for all your help and all your support in our NATO accession. I do appreciate it very, very much.
We met with you, President, in—I met you in the White House last week. And we met, all of us, in the NATO summit yesterday. And now we meet in Helsinki. So, recently, I have met you more than I met my own family, actually. [Laughter] I like it a lot. [Laughter]
And I think there is a great potential for even closer U.S.-Nordic cooperation in all these fields of security, of green transition. I think basically a stronger transatlantic link in our time's big challenges—not least in relation to China, for example—that is an answer to many questions.
So I really hope these are a few of the topics we will be able to discuss here today. Thanks.

"July 13, 2023","The President's News Conference With President Sauli Niinistö of Finland in Helsinki, Finland","
Moderator. Thank you. Please be seated.
Welcome to this joint press conference by President of the Republic of Finland, Sauli Niinistö, and President of the United States, Joe Biden.
We will begin with statements by the presidents.
President Niinistö. Thank you, and good afternoon.
Excellent that we have this kind of a big hall in the castle. Plenty of you here.
First of all, Joe, Mr. President, I want to thank you for visiting Finland. We have had possibilities of meeting each other quite often during the——
President Biden. And I like it here even better. [Laughter]
President Niinistö. Yes. [Laughter] And by the way, first time we met, also in Helsinki, I was the Speaker of Parliament when you visited.
President Biden. I remember.
President Niinistö. So we have had a lot of discussions during the last couple years. I want to, once again, thank you for the strong support you have given all the time.
President Biden. It's my honor.
President Niinistö. The new era in Finnish security policy has begun, and you will be one of those who brought it to history.
I also want to thank you for the Vilnius meeting. It was very touching to feel the unity between allies. And I think it was greatly created by you.
We had possibilities of discussing bilaterally today. I took up the negotiations of our defense cooperation agreement. We are going to continue our security discussion bilat, and that is of vital importance to Finland.
In the same time, also, Sweden and Denmark are having similar discussions. And at the end, it seems that all the five Nordic countries will have a bilateral agreement with U.S.A.
Technology is one of the key words for the future. There are elements like artificial intelligence, quantum technology, sky technology. All that is leading our way to the future. And we have to make sure that it's leading our way in a very secure way. And that demands responsibility of those who know how. And that is why it is very important to coordinate and cooperate with our knowledge and resources forward in this sector.
We also had a discussion on our neighbor, and I think that we both share similar views. The war in Ukraine was also discussed. We both see that we will continue support to Ukraine, which is defending not only herself, but also all the values we represent in the western world.
We also had a meeting with the Nordic family. It is a tradition, which started during President Obama's time, and it has been a very valuable tool for us to get—even better understand each other's security and technology. They're also discussed there. And a lot of time and thoughts were presented on environmental issues.
So, once again, it has been great to have you here.
President Biden. Well, thank you, Mr. President. It's been great to be here.
Look, it's an honor to be with you and our other Nordic friends. We just finished, I would suggest, a very productive U.S.-Nordic leaders summit on the heels of the historic NATO summit in Vilnius and—where Finland took its place at the table as an—as our newest ally. We've always been friends, but our newest official ally member of NATO.
And I also want to thank Minister Kristersson of Sweden, who will soon be joining NATO, and Prime Minister Støre of Norway. She—we've had a great relationship. And Frederiksen of Denmark, and the Minister Jakoblindóttir [Jakobsdóttir; White House correction] of Ireland—or—""daughter of Ireland."" You can tell that's a Freudian slip; I'm thinking of home. The daughter of Iceland.
And I want to say I think we've had a very productive summit. We discussed, Mr. President, where we stand at an inflection point in history where the decisions we make now are going to determine the course of the history for the next four or five, six decades.
And this week, we affirmed how Finland and the United States, together—together with allies and partners—are working in lockstep to set us on a stronger, safer, and more secure path, not just for Europe, not just for NATO, but for the world.
In Vilnius, NATO met with 33 nations for the first—31 nations for the first time. We showed the world our alliance is more united than ever. And soon, it will be 32 allies, thanks to an agreement with Turkey to move Sweden's accession protocols forward.
And as capable partners and committed democracies, both Finland and Sweden are going to add significantly to the strength, security, and unanimity of NATO. And a stronger NATO makes the entire world stronger.
Mr. President, as your ally, we want the people of Finland to know the United States is committed to Finland, committed to NATO, and those commitments are rock solid; that we will defend every inch of NATO territory, and that includes Finland, obviously.
Second, over the past week, we reaffirmed our unwavering support for the brave people of Ukraine as they defend their country against Russia's brutal and inhumane attacks.
Our allies and partners around the world understand that this fight is not only a fight for the future of Ukraine; it's about sovereignty, security, and freedom itself.
I want you to think about what would happen if we didn't do anything, what is likely to happen in the rest of Europe if we did nothing.
So, this week, NATO has officially elevated our relationship with Ukraine. Allies also agreed to lift the membership action plan that's usually required before you can be admitted and—from Ukraine. And it's created a path for membership for Ukraine as it continues to make progress on the necessary democratic and security reforms required of every NATO member.
We also made clear to President Zelenskyy that we're not waiting for NATO membership to be finalized to commit to the long-term security of Ukraine. The leaders of the G-7 together issued a new Joint Declaration of Support for Ukraine, a declaration I was glad to see the Nordic nations immediately welcomed and supported.
It's going to launch a process, open to any nation, to negotiate bilateral security agreements with—Ukraine until they're officially members of NATO. It will not only ensure that Ukraine can defend itself today, but it will deter future aggression as well, with a capable force across land, air, and sea from their friends.
And finally, at every stop of—in every summit on this trip, we focused on using the power of partnership to take on the challenges that matter most to the people's lives in our countries.
In the United Kingdom, we brought together public, private, and philanthropic partners to discuss ways to unlock literally trillions of private dollars in finance to fight climate change.
In Lithuania, NATO allies met, and the EU and our Indo-Pacific partners, to continue advancing our work on terrorism, cyber threats, resilience, and so much more.
And here in Finland, at our U.S.-Nordic leaders summit, we reaffirmed our commitment to stand together, power—to power a clean energy transition; to preserve regional security; to promote democratic values; and to pioneer the technologies of the future, from quantum computing to advanced communications systems. So we did it together.
Mr. President, at this critical moment in history, this inflection point, the world is watching to see: Will we do the hard work that matters to forge a better future? Will we stand together? Will we stand with one another? Will we stay committed to our course?
This week, Finland and the United States and our allies and partners said a resounding, loud ""yes."" Yes, we'll step up. Yes, we'll stand together. And yes, we'll keep working toward a stronger, safer, and more secure world.
So, Mr. President, thank you again for having me here. As partners, friends, and allies, I look forward to our work together in the years ahead. And it's been a real pleasure getting to know you even better.
Thank you.
Moderator. Thank you. Now we have time for questions.
President Niinistö. Shall we start with YLE, Iida Tikka? You.
North Atlantic Treaty Organization 
Q. Iida Tikka, Finnish Public Broadcasting Service. My question is for Mr. President Biden. The political volatility of U.S. remains a big worry for European partners. Meanwhile, back in Washington, a bipartisan group of Senators has repeatedly failed to pass through Senate a bill that would prevent the U.S. Presidents in the future from withdrawing from NATO without Senate's approval. What actions——
President Biden. Sorry, what, I'm sorry? I didn't hear the last part of your question.
Q. In Washington, a bipartisan group of Senators has repeatedly failed to pass through Senate a law that would prevent future U.S. Presidents from withdrawing from NATO without Senate's approval. What actions will you take to assure Finland that the U.S. will remain a reliable NATO partner for decades to come?
President Biden. I absolutely guarantee it. There is no question. There's overwhelming support from the American people. There's overwhelming support from the Members of the Congress, both House and Senate. In both parties, notwithstanding the fact there are some extreme elements of one party, we will stand together.
The American people have known for the—since the end of World War II and the formation of NATO that our security rests in the unanimity among European and transatlantic partner—us. And so this is—you know, no one can guarantee the future, but this is the best bet anyone could make.
Q. And my second question, on that note, to Mr. President Niinistö. Hearing this answer that no one can guarantee a future, are you worried that the political instability in U.S. will cause issues in the alliance in the future?
President Biden. Let me be clear: I didn't say we didn't guarantee—we couldn't guarantee the future. You can't tell me whether you're going to be able to go home tonight. No one can be sure what they're going to do.
I'm saying, as sure as anything can possibly be said about American foreign policy, we will stay connected to NATO—connected to NATO, beginning, middle, and end. We're a transatlantic partnership. That's what I've said.
President Niinistö. It seems that the President has answered your problems. [Laughter]
But I have to tell you that during this process, I met approximately—President many times—but I would say about 50 people from Congress and Senate. And I think the message was quite clear, quite united. And I have no reason to doubt about U.S.A. policies in the future.
President Biden. Let me say one more thing. We learned a hard lesson. Peace and security in Europe is essential to U.S. security and peace. The idea that there could be conflict in Europe among our friends and us not engaged has never happened in modern history. That's why we're staying together.
Moderator. Next question, President Biden.
President Biden. Oh, I have to call on somebody. I'm sorry.
Wall Street Journal. Andrew [Andrew Restuccia].
North Atlantic Treaty Organization/Ukraine/Russia 
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. You've said that Ukraine shouldn't enter NATO until after the war is over. Are you concerned at all that those comments could motivate Putin to keep the war going or discourage him from entering peace negotiations?
And is there a serious risk that this war could drag on for years? And do you see any path toward the war ending with Putin still in power?
President Biden. First of all, no one can join NATO while the war—a war is going on, where a NATO nation is being attacked, because that guarantees that we're in a war and we're in a third world war. So that is not about whether or not they should or shouldn't join. It's about when they can join. And they will join NATO.
The issue of whether or not this is going to keep Putin from continuing to fight, the answer is: Putin has already lost the war. Putin has a real problem. How does he move from here? What does he do? And so the idea that there's going to be—what vehicle is used, he could end the war tomorrow; he could just say, ""I'm out.""
But what agreement is ultimately reached depends upon Putin and what he decides to do. But there is no possibility of him winning the war in Ukraine. He's already lost that war. Imagine if—even if—anyway. He's already lost that war.
Q. And just on the question of a concern about it going on for years: Is there a possibility that there's a stalemate and this becomes——
President Biden. I'm sorry?
Ukraine/Russia 
Q. The question of whether the war could go on for years. Is there a possibility there's a stalemate and it can continue for quite some time?
President Biden. Well, I don't think the war can go on for years for two reasons. Number one, I don't think that they—that Russia could maintain the war forever—number one—in terms of their resources and capacity.
Number two, I think that there is going to be a circumstance where, eventually, President Putin is going to decide it's not in the interest of Russia—economically, politically, or otherwise—to continue this war. But I can't predict exactly how that happens.
My hope is, and my expectation is, you'll see that Ukraine makes significant progress on their offensive and that it generates a negotiated settlement somewhere along the line.
U.S. Citizens Detained Abroad 
Q. And I have a question for the Finnish President. But I would be remiss if I didn't raise my colleague, Evan Gershkovich, who's been in prison for more than a hundred days. I just wondered if you had an update on the process for trying to get him out of prison and if you're serious about a prisoner exchange.
President Biden. Oh, I'm serious about a prisoner exchange. I'm serious about doing all we can to free Americans who are being illegally held in Russia or anywhere else for that matter. And that process is underway.
Q. And for the Finnish Prime Minister [President; White House correction], do you envision the possibility of the U.S. having a permanent military base in Finland?
President Niinistö. Like I told, we are discussing on DCA, the defense cooperation agreement, and it has a lot of elements. They are still open. But we are open on negotiations, and I know that our counterpart is also very open. So let us see.
Moderator. Next question goes to President Niinistö. Please.
President Niinistö. Yes, it's Helsingin Sanomat, Elina Väntönen.
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. And my question is for Mr. President Biden. [Laughter]
President Biden. Okay.
Finland's Accession to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization 
Q. Or should I just say President Biden? [Laughter] You have repeatedly talked about Finlandization becoming NATOization of Finland. Now, based on your——
President Biden. Sorry, I—what nation?
Q. You have repeatedly talked about Finlandization——
President Biden. Oh, I see.
Q. ——becoming NATOization of Finland. Based on your long experience, how does that change Finland's place in the world?
President Biden. Well, first of all, the context in which I said that was: The gentleman who occupies a seat on the other side of the—your border, in Moscow, said he wanted—I said he wanted the Findalization [Finlandization; White House correction] of NATO. I said it was more likely he's going to get the NATOization of Finland. [Laughter] That's what—that's the context in which that was said.
And what was the second part of your question?
Q. I asked: How has Finland's position in the world changed during this——
President Biden. Look——
Q. ——NATO membership process?
President Biden. ——Finland is already a strong, vibrant nation. I think what Finland's joining NATO does—and with Sweden as well—when the Nordic countries are all members of NATO: It just makes the world safer. It significantly increases the prospect that there is less likely to be war.
We'll—we're deadly earnest about the notion. We'll defend every single inch of NATO territory. And now we're going to—we're on the way of getting to 32 NATO nations. That's a significant commitment. And so the likelihood of any nation voluntarily deciding they're going to attack one of the nations or Finland is highly unlikely.
And so—but if it were to, they understand they're not just attacking Finland; they're attacking 31 other countries.
Moderator. Next question, President Biden, please.
President Biden. Oh, I'm sorry. I guess it's Arlette [Arlette Saenz] from CNN.
Russia/Nuclear Weapons/Wagner Group Mercenary Organization Leader Yevgeniy Viktorovich Prigozhin of Russia 
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. We've seen more disarray with Russian generals, most recently with the firing of a general who criticized the Defense Ministry. This following that rebellion by Prigozhin. Does this raise any new concerns about Putin potentially doing more drastic things regarding Ukraine, like nuclear weapons, or potentially against the U.S., like election interference?
President Biden. Well, first of all, they already interfered in American elections. So that would not be anything new. They did that last time—they tried to.
But with regard to—I don't think there's any real prospect—you never know—but of Putin using nuclear weapons. Not only has the West, but China and the rest of the world has said: ""That's—don't go there. Don't go there."" Number two.
Number three, I think that determining what happens to Prigozhin and what happens to Vilnius—I mean—excuse me, what happens when we discussed this in Vilnius is, God only knows what he's likely to do. Well, I'm not even sure—we're not even sure where he is and what relationship he has. If I were he, I'd be careful what I ate. I'd be keeping my eye on my menu.
But all kidding aside, I who knows? I don't know. I don't think any of us know for sure what the future of Prigozhin is in Russia. And so I don't know how to answer that question beyond that.
Senator Thomas H. Tuberville/U.S. Military Promotions 
Q. And if I could also ask you something about—happening back home. You're seeing the GOP grappling with tying abortion rights to defense issues, including a block on military promotions by Senator Tuberville. What does this say about U.S. military readiness? And would you be willing to talk with Tuberville to try to work out some solution?
President Biden. I'd be willing to talk to him if I thought there was any possibility of him changing this ridiculous position he has. He's jeopardizing U.S. security by what he's doing.
I expect the Republican Party to stand up—stand up—and do something about it. They—it's within their power to do that.
The idea that we don't have a Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; the idea that we have all these—all these promotions that are in abeyance right now and we don't know what's going to happen; the idea that we're injecting into fundamental foreign policy decisions what, in fact, is a domestic social debate on social issues is bizarre.
I don't ever recall that happening, ever. And it's just totally irresponsible, in my view.
And I just think that—I mean, I'm confident that the mainstream Republican Party no longer—does not support what he's doing. But they've got to stand up and be counted. That's how it ends.
Q. And for President Niinistö, you've been working on fortifying the fence along the border between Finland and Russia. Is there anything that you're seeing recently that concerns you? And also, as a leader who shares a border with Russia, what more do you want to see done to deter Putin?
President Niinistö. During the beginning of our application process, surely, we had to make sure, first, trying to figure out every possible negative action we might meet and, surely, how we response from that. And we were very careful on that work.
So, at the moment, the situation is quite calm. Hope it remains as such.
But I just want to tell you that Finnish people do feel more secure. At the moment, we have 80 percent of our population supporting NATO membership and more than 80 percent who say that we will also protect our allies. That's the Finnish position.
Moderator. Thank you. This concludes the press conference.
President Biden. Thank you very much.
Q. Do have a response to—[inaudible]?
Q. Mr. President, are you satisfied with—[inaudible]?

"July 12, 2023","Remarks With Prime Minister Fumio Kishida of Japan and President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of Ukraine on the Group of Seven (G-7) Nations Joint Declaration of Support for Ukraine in Vilnius, Lithuania","
Prime Minister Kishida. I am pleased to be able to announce the Joint Declaration on Support for Ukraine today.
At the G-7 Hiroshima summit, by engaging in discussions that included a wide range of invited countries, we agreed that unilateral attempts to change the status quo by force or coercion are unacceptable anywhere in the world and to safeguard a free and open international order based on the rule of law.
I feel that it is truly meaningful that we, the G-7 leaders, and Volodymyr have gathered once again today. Going forward, this declaration will be open to any country that shares the intention to support Ukraine. I hope many countries will choose to join. The G-7 will continue to stand by Ukraine. Our solidarity will never waver.
Thank you very much.
President Biden. Let me start off by saying something that I hadn't planned on saying. You know, I think there are very few people in Europe or in the continental United States, in the North American continent, that thought this man would stand up and come to the aid and assistance of Ukraine. He increased his military budget. He stepped up—Japan—Japan—because he understood that when any part of the world has 185,000 people, soldiers crossing a border, stealing sovereignty from another nation, that it affects the whole world.
I want to thank you again publicly.
We've just concluded the first meeting of the NATO-Ukraine Council and—where all our allies agreed Ukraine's future lies in NATO. That's not a surprise to any of us, I don't think. I hope it's not a surprise to you, Mr. President.
Allies all agreed to lift the requirements for Membership Action Plan for Ukraine and to create a path to NATO membership while Ukraine continues to make progress on necessary reforms.
But we're not waiting for that process to be finished to make the long-term commitments that we're making to Ukraine's security. Volodymyr and I, we—the—I shouldn't be so familiar—Mr. Zelenskyy and I talked about the kind of guarantees we could make in the meantime when I was in Ukraine and when we met in other places.
And so today the long-term commitments we're making are backed up by the notion that in the meantime we're going to provide security to Ukraine for its needs and against any aggression that may occur.
Today the members of the G-7 are launching a Joint Declaration of Support for Ukraine to make it clear that our support will last long into the future. This starts a process by which each of our nations and any other nation who wishes to participate will negotiate long-term bilateral security commitments with and to Ukraine.
We're going to help Ukraine build a strong, capable defense across land, air, and sea from which we will force the—it will be a force of stability in the region and deter against any and all threats.
I want to thank my fellow G-7 leaders and President Zelenskyy for their work to make this happen. I think it's a powerful statement—a powerful statement—of our commitment to Ukraine as it defends its freedom today and as it rebuilds the future for—and we're going to be there as long as that takes.
And, again, I thank all my colleagues for their support for this.
President Zelenskyy. Thank you very much, Mr. President.
President Biden; Prime Minister Kishida; Chancellor—I don't see—I see you—Chancellor Scholz; Prime Minister Sunak; President Macron; Prime Minister Trudeau; Prime Minister Meloni; President Michel; President von der Leyen: A great honor to be here.
The outcome of the NATO summit in Vilnius is very much needed and meaningful success for Ukraine. And I am grateful to all leaders in NATO countries for very practical and unprecedented support considering decades of our relations' support for Ukraine.
Today, there are security guarantees for Ukraine on the way to NATO, an important package of security guarantees. Today, we are coordinating with the G-7 countries the framework for security guarantee that shall be further extended through arrangements with our key partners, bilateral and multilateral agreements.
And Ukrainian delegation is bringing home significant security victory for the Ukraine, for our country, for our people, for our children. It opens for us absolutely new security opportunities, and I thank everyone who made it possible. Thank you, dear colleagues. Thanks, you—thanks, Lithuanian, and Jens Stoltenberg. Thank you very much.
Slava Ukraini.

"July 12, 2023","Remarks Prior to a Meeting With President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of Ukraine and an Exchange With Reporters in Vilnius, Lithuania","
President Biden. Well, Mr. President, welcome. And I hope you all got a sense today from all of my colleagues that—how much that you have—how much support you have. It's real. And I hope we finally have put to bed the notion about whether or not Ukraine is welcome in NATO. It's going to happen. We're moving—you're all moving in the right direction. And I think it's just a matter of getting by the next few months here.
So thank you, thank you, thank you.
And you know, it's hard to believe: 500 days. It's easy for me just mostly—I've been in and out of Ukraine a lot before the war, and some since the war. But I'm going to say again what I've said to you many times, not only all of you, but your people—your sons, your daughters, your husbands, your wives, your friends: You're incredible.
Ukraine—the whole world has seen the courage—I really—I mean this from the bottom of my heart—the courage and commitment of the average Ukrainian. When you see a 65-year-old woman on television after her apartment's been bombed out, picking up the pieces and going to help the next-door neighbor—I mean, it's just astounding. You've set an example for the whole world of what constitutes genuine courage in my—I mean—from the bottom of my heart, I mean that—what courage means. And you know, I think it's—your resilience and your resolve has been a model for the whole world to see.
And the frustration, I can only imagine. I know you're many times frustrated about when things—what things get to you quickly enough and what's getting to you and how we're getting there. But I promise you, the United States is doing everything we can to get you what you need as rapidly as we can get it to you.
And the Secretary of Defense has been a constant, constant—how can I say it?—the refrain—from the Defense Department and everywhere else to—and calling other Secretaries of Defense around the world to say, ""Let's get some help.""
So I just want you to know it's real. And you know, here in Vilnius, we held the first, as you well know, NATO-Ukraine Council. But you and I talked about this beforehand, about the commitments—the security commitments we were going to make while it becomes official—until it becomes official. And I think that's important.
And I might—I want to tell you: When I got here, Mr. President, and I started to sell that idea to other heads of state, there was no reluctance. There was no—no ""Well, I don't want to""—[inaudible]—it was—everybody just said: ""Okay. Let's sign on."" So it's real.
You've done an enormous job. You have a lot more to do, I know. And I just think that, you know, we're going to make sure that you get what you need. And I look forward to the day when we're having the meeting celebrating your official—official——membership in NATO.
So thank you for what you're doing. And the bad news for you is, we're not going anywhere. [Laughter] You're stuck with us.
So thank you.
President Zelenskyy. Thank you very much, Mr. President. And I will start.
You said about 500 days. It's really, really a difficult job for our people—soldiers and civilians, mothers, fathers, and children—really, to fight for their life—for their life and for these values.
And thank you very much that all these days you are with us. I mean, you and Americans, all of America—Americans and Congress. I mean, thank you, Mr. President, that you—like we say, shoulder to shoulder with us from first days of full-scale war. We appreciate for this very much.
And really—really, you know, we understand you're leading support, because when you give such messages and when you gave sometimes some weapon—I'm sorry that I'm—but I want to say to journalists, like I said during our meeting, our council, that it's very simple, you know, to criticize, for example, clusters munition, which you made decision—difficult political decision. But it's—but you have to know that Russia used such weapon from the first days, not only full-scale war—from first days of occupation of Crimea, from 2014 and '15, in all our territories. In Donbas, they used it. And now they continue doing. And that you gave us—this decision will help us to save us.
And that's why my appreciation for the—and I didn't hear from all the, you know, parts of the world when Russia began to use it—I didn't hear that some of, you know, countries criticized Russia. You know? But I think that it was very useful to put them.
So thank you so much for this help. We really counted on it—not only on this. I mean this—totally. And you gave us huge support.
I want to thank to all Americans. We understand that it's more than 43 billions for today. It's big support. And I understand that it's all your money, but you have to know that you spend this money for—not just for fighting; you spend this money for our lives. And the—I think that we save the lives for Europe and for all the world.
So thank you very much for this also summit. At the end of the summit, we had—I think this council had great success and security guarantees, as you said, that we began to speak it—about it in Kyiv.
So now we see that we had—you had great idea, that G-7—and now I know that—last message is—that also there are countries which joined to G-7 decisions, and I think it will help very much because it—it's real effect that—it's very—[inaudible]—phase.
So thank you.
President Biden. Well, thank you. And thank you for acknowledging the American people. I think it's correct that we are a large country, but I think we've given more than every other nation combined in terms of assistance and cost.
And the American people are supportive—they're supportive—because they know it's about you, but it's about more than you. It's about innocent people around the world and the absolute brutality with which Putin is acting and the Russians are moving on. It's just—it's just some—like something out of the 14th century the way they're acting.
And so—but I can't emphasize enough.
And by the way, I know you thanked him, but I think we talked about it before. I went to Tokyo years—more—a couple years ago. The idea that Kishida is increasing their defense budget, having to lower their domestic budget, to aid directly and get directly involved in what's happening in Ukraine is remarkable.
The sad, sad news is, you're in this situation. The incredible news is, it's bringing the world together. It's bringing the world together in a way that—it's a hell of a price to pay, but it's bringing the world together. And people are realizing that they just can't stand by and let this kind of aggression occur.
Any rate, I thank you, and we've got a lot to talk about. So somebody is going to have to say, ""The press has to leave."" [Laughter]
Q. President Zelenskyy, are you satisfied with what you got from NATO? You were so frustrated yesterday. Is this enough? Are you satisfied, sir?
President Zelenskyy. I think, at the end of summit, we have great unity from our leaders and security guarantees, that the success for this summit. I think so, but it's my opinion. Thank you.
Q. Thank you, sir.
Ukraine/North Atlantic Treaty Organization 
Q. President Zelenskyy, how soon after the war would you like to be in NATO? How soon after the war would you like to join NATO?
President Biden. An hour and 20 minutes. You guys ask really insightful questions. [Laughter]

"July 12, 2023","Remarks in Vilnius, Lithuania","
The President. Hello, Lithuania! As my mother would say, ""God love you."" No seats. Holy mackerel. [Laughter]
It's good to be back in Vilnius, a nation and a region that knows better than anyone the transformational power of freedom. You know, you showed the world that the strength of a people united cannot be denied.
And together, with your brothers and sisters in Estonia and Latvia, you helped end the era of division through the power of connection. The Baltic Way, not the Berlin Wall, became the symbol for Europe's future.
And later, when Soviet tanks sought once more to deny your independence, the people of Vilnius said, ""No."" No, no, no. And in January of 1991, tens of thousands of citizens, unarmed and unyielding, came for their own—of their own accord, standing as one to protect the TV Tower, to shield the Supreme Council, and defend freedom.
Fourteen heroes tragically lost their lives. Hundreds were wounded. But the whole world saw that decades of oppression had done nothing to dim the flame of liberty in this country. I mean it. It's consequential.
The light of Lithuania: You kept it strong. You kept it bright. And you kept the light shining here in Vilnius and in Washington, DC, where the yellow, green, and red of your flag flew every day.
This past year, we've celebrated a hundred years of unbroken diplomatic relationship between the United States and the Baltic States. America—America—never recognized the Soviet occupation of the Baltics. Never, never, never, Mr. President.
And besides, you've got a great President. [Applause] Stand up. No, stand up. As your President can tell you, the bonds between Lithuanian and the American people have never faltered.
And just 7 months after the bloody January crackdown, the first foreign visitor to have their passports stamped here in Lithuania with visas of this—to this new, reborn state were a planeload of Lithuanian Americans from Chicago, Illinois. [Applause] Oh. [Laughter] And their families are still proud of that.
Audience member. From Los Angeles.
The President. Los Angeles came after that. [Laughter] A lot came after.
Look, many aboard that plane had fled Lithuania during the early years of Soviet oppression and marveled—marveled—at their return to this independent state. One of them told reporters, quote, ""This day is like a resurrection for us."" ""This day, Father, is like a resurrection for us."" That's what the quote was, for real. That's the feeling.
And it was: a resurrection that quickly became a revelation. And a nation which stands today as a stronghold of liberty and opportunity, a proud member of the European Union and of NATO.
I had the great honor as a United States Senator of championing Lithuania and other Baltic States to join NATO in 2004. Wasn't I brilliant doing that? [Laughter] But, all kidding aside, think about what it—how it's changed things. Think about what's happened.
Now, over the last few days, as President of the United States, I had the honor of participating in a historic NATO summit hosted by Lithuania, where we welcomed NATO's newest ally, Finland, and reached agreement to bring Sweden into the alliance as soon as possible. And President Erdogan kept his word.
We've witnessed your historic journey. And I'm proud to call Lithuania friend, partner, and ally. Ally. Ally.
Soon, NATO will be the 32d freestanding—have free—30 free—32 freestanding members—[laughter]—standing together to defend our people and our territory, beyond—beyond all the rest, bound by democratic values to make us strong and by our sacred oath that an attack against—it is a sacred oath—attack against one is an attack against all. Because each member of NATO knows that the strength of our people and the power of our unity cannot be denied.
If I sound optimistic, it's because I am. Today, our alliance remains a bulwark of global security and stability as it's been for more than seven decades. NATO is stronger, more energized, and, yes, more united than ever in its history. Indeed, more vital to our shared future.
It didn't happen by accident. It wasn't inevitable.
When Putin, and his craven lust for land and power, unleashed his brutal war on Ukraine, he was betting NATO would break apart. He was betting NATO would break. He thought our unity would shatter at the first testing. He thought democratic leaders would be weak. But he thought wrong.
Faced with a threat—[applause]. Faced with a threat to the peace and stability of the world, to democratic values we hold dear, to freedom itself, we did what we always do: The United States stepped up. NATO stepped up. Our partners in Europe, in the—and then the Indo-Pacific stepped up. All across the world they stepped up.
And we're ready—we were ready because we stood together.
In the months leading up to the war, as Putin amassed his forces on the Ukrainian border and laid the groundwork for his brutal invasion, it was—I was in constant contact with my fellow leaders of the G-7 and the European Union and NATO, constantly.
We warned the world what Putin was planning. Even some in Ukraine didn't believe we were—what we had—our intelligence community found. We made sure NATO was prepared to deter any aggression against any member state. We pursued intense diplomacy with Russia, seeking to avert this terrible war. And when Russian bombs began to fall, we did not hesitate to act.
We rallied the world to support the brave people of Ukraine as they defend their liberty and their sovereignty with incredible dignity. I mean that from the bottom of my heart. Think about it. Think about what they're doing.
After nearly a year and a half of Russia's forces committing terrible atrocities, including crimes against humanity, the people of Ukraine remain unbroken. Unbroken. Ukraine remains independent. It remains free. And the United States has built a coalition of more than 50 nations to make sure Ukraine defends itself both now and is able to do it in the future as well.
Since this war began, I've stood with President Zelenskyy—as I just spent about an hour with him—both in Washington, in Kyiv, in Hiroshima, and now in Vilnius, to declare to the world what I say again: We will not waver. We will not waver. I mean that. Our commitment to Ukraine will not weaken. We will stand for liberty and freedom today, tomorrow, and for as long as it takes.
We all want this war to end on just terms, terms that uphold the basic principles of the United Nations Charter that we all signed up to: sovereignty, territorial integrity. These are two pillars of peaceful relations among nations. One country cannot be allowed to seize its neighbor's territory by force.
Russia could end this war tomorrow by withdrawing its forces from Ukraine, recognize these international borders, and ceasing its attacks on its—inhumane attacks on Russia—I mean, by Russia on Ukraine, against its children—women and children; its military.
Unfortunately, Russia has shown thus far no interest in a diplomatic outcome. Putin still wrongly believes that he can outlast Ukraine. He can't believe it's their land, their country, and their future.
And even after all this time, Putin still doubts our staying power. He's still making a bad bet that the conviction and the unity among the United States and our allies and partners will break down.
He still doesn't understand that our commitment to our values, our freedom is something he [we; White House correction] can never, never, ever, ever walk away from. It's who we are. I mean it: It's who we are. It's who we are.
Throughout this horrific war, the people of Lithuania, together with our Baltic brethren, have been among the fiercest—most fierce champions of Ukraine's right to a future of its own choosing: one that is free.
Because you lived so long with freedom denied, many of you who are older know better than anyone how precious the right to determine your own future is, precious to people everywhere—everywhere—not just in Ukraine, but Belarus, Moldova, Georgia, all the places around the world where people continue to fight to make their voices heard.
So my message—my message—to all of you tonight is: Keep it up. Keep it going. Keep reminding the world of hope that Lithuania embodies. And that's what you embody: hope in this country. [Applause] No, I really mean it. I'm not joking. I mean this sincerely.
We must never forget how much this matters and never, never give up on a better tomorrow. The defense of freedom is not the work of a day or a year. It's the calling of our lifetime, of all time.
We are steeled for the struggle ahead. Our unity will not falter. I promise you.
Folks, as I look around the world today, at a moment of war and peril, a moment of competition and uncertainty, I also see a moment of unprecedented opportunity—unprecedented opportunity—opportunity to make real strides toward a world of greater peace and greater prosperity, liberty and dignity, equal justice under the law, human rights and fundamental freedoms which are the blessing and birthright of all of humanity.
That—that—is the world the United States is working toward. And it's one we'll only reach if we do it together, and I mean together.
We need to take the same spirit of unity, common purpose, determination that we have demonstrated in our response to Russian aggression in Ukraine and bring more partners along as we continue working to build a world we want to live in and a world we want for our children.
My friends, at the most fundamental level, we face a choice—it's not hyperbole—we face a choice: a choice between a world defined by coercion and exploitation, where might makes right, or a world where we recognize that our own success is bound to the success of others.
When others do better, we do better as well; where we understand that the challenges we face today, from the existential threat of climate change to building a global economy where no one gets left behind, are too great for any one nation to solve on their own, and that to achieve our goals and meet the challenges of this age, we have to work together.
And I mean this sincerely: The world is changing. We have a chance to change the dynamic. That's why I've been so focused as President on rebuilding and revitalizing these alliances that are the cornerstone of American leadership in the world.
These past years, we have brought the transatlantic partnership to new heights, reaffirming the importance of the relationship between Europe and the United States as an anchor to global stability. The idea that the United States could prosper without a secure Europe is not reasonable. We've also elevated—[applause]—that's—it really isn't. Not a joke.
I sometimes—well—we also elevated and deepened America's alliance in the Indo-Pacific with Japan, the Republic of Korea, Australia, and the Philippines, which provide critical security and deterrence in that vital region of the world.
Through our Quad partnership—it's a fancy way of saying our partnership with Australia, India, Japan, and the United States—we're bringing major democracies of the region together to cooperate, keeping the Indo-Pacific free and open, prosperous, and secure.
We've demonstrated during this NATO summit, with Indo-Pacific partners joining us for the second year in a row, we're working to deepen connections between the Atlantic and Pacific democracies so they can better work together toward the shared values we all seek: strong alliances, versatile partnerships, common purpose, collective action to meet our shared challenges.
The world has shrunk. That's how we build a future to see. But we share and know we share challenges and work together. We have to step up together, building the broadest and deepest coalition to strengthen and defend the basic rules of the road, to preserve all the extraordinary benefits that stem from the international system grounded in the rule of law.
We have to come together to protect the rights and freedoms; to underwrite the flow of ideas and commerce and—which have enabled decades of global growth. Yes, territorial integrity and sovereignty, but also principles like freedom of navigation and overflight, keeping our shared seas and skies open so that every nation has equal access to our global common space.
And as we continue to explore this age of new possibilities, an age enabled by rapid advances in innovation, we have to stand together to ensure that the common spaces of our future reflect our highest aspirations for ourselves and for others—as my dad would say, that everybody has—is treated with some dignity—so that artificial intelligence, engineering biology, and other engineering technologies—emerging technologies are not made into weapons of oppression, but rather they're used as tools of opportunity.
We're working with our allies and partners to build a supply chains that are more resilient, more secure, so we never again face a situation like we had during the pandemic where we couldn't get critical goods we needed for our daily lives.
You know, we all must summon the common will to actually address the existential threat of accelerating climate change. It's real. It's serious. And we don't have a lot of time. It is the—the—single greatest threat to humanity. And it's only by working together that we'll prevent the worst consequences of climate change from ravaging our future and that of our children and grandchildren.
We also have to recognize our shared responsibility to help unlock the enormous potential that exists in low- and middle-income companies [countries; White House correction] around the world, not out of charity, but because it's in our own self-interest. We all benefit when more partners stand together, working toward shared goals. We all benefit when people are healthier and more prosperous. And that's not, again, hyperbole. It's true. We all benefit when more entrepreneurs and innovators are able to pursue their dreams for a better tomorrow.
You know, so we need to update our toolset to better address the needs of today in this interconnected world, a world where climate disasters, pandemics, conflicts spill over borders and make it harder to address the challenges of poverty and instability that hold so many people back.
That's why the United States is leading an effort to transform the multilateral development banks, like the World Bank, to help them better address the global challenges while enhancing their core mission of reducing poverty and boost shared prosperity.
We're all working together with our partners in the G-7 to address the enormous needs for high-standard infrastructure around the world, especially in low- and middle-income countries in Africa, Latin America, and Southeast Asia. It's a statement about the world we want to build together.
Ladies and gentlemen, we stand at an inflection point, an inflection point in history, where the choices we make now are going to shape the direction of our world for decades to come. The world has changed.
Will we turn back naked, unchecked aggression today to deter other world—would-be aggressors tomorrow? Will we staunch the climate crisis before it's too late? Will we harness the new technologies to advance freedom, or will we diminish it? Will we advance opportunity in more places or allow instability and inequality to persist?
How we answer these essential questions is literally going to determine the kind of future our children and grandchildren have. And, again, that's not an exaggeration; that's a fact. It's going to take all of us. All of us.
I believe that with ambition, with confidence in ourselves and one another, with nations working together for common cause, we can answer these questions. We can ensure the vision we share and the freedoms we cherish are not just empty words in a troubled time, but a roadmap—and I mean this literally—a roadmap, a plan of urgent action toward a future we can reach, and we'll reach if we work together.
Folks, the road that lies before us is hard. It will challenge us, summon the best of ourselves to hold faith in one another and never give up, never lose hope. Never.
Every day, we have to make the choice. Every day, we must summon the strength to stand for what is right, to stand for what is true, to stand for freedom, to stand together.
And that, my friends, is the lesson we learn from history and the history of Lithuania's story. You know, it's the lesson we see demonstrated each day, and it will determine—it will determine—what the Ukraine looks like. And it is now—it's how we're going to work—how we rewrite the future of peace and hope, justice and light, liberty, possibilities for everyone—everyone, everywhere.
Folks, some have heard me say to my country many times: I have never, ever in my entire career been more optimistic about the prospects of the future. Never. Never.
So let me just say thank you for taking the time to be here to listen.
God bless you all, and may God protect the freedoms of the—the protectors of freedom in Ukraine, here, in every nation in the world, everywhere. God protect our troops.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

The President. You all ready to go to Finland?
The President's Travel to Finland 
Q. Are you ready?
Q. How'd it go?
The President. I'm ready. Have you ever seen me not ready?
Anyway.
President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of Ukraine/North Atlantic Treaty Organization Summit/Turkey/Sweden 
Q. How did your meeting with Zelenskyy go? Did you talk about long-range missiles?
The President. It went very well, and I think he'd tell you that. We spent about an hour together, and I think we're on the right track.
And so I'm feeling good about the trip. And you know, we accomplished every goal we set out to accomplish. I know there was some cynicism about whether I could talk the Turks into Sweden and——
Ukraine/North Atlantic Treaty Organization 
Q. How long do you think it'll take to get Ukraine into NATO? I mean, it's not for a while, right?
The President. I think until the war is over.
But look, the one thing Zelenskyy understands now is that whether or not he's in NATO now is not relevant as long as he has the commitments that—you remember my talking about saying we'd treat it like—guarantee his security, along with a number of other NATO countries, as it related to how we deal with, for example, Israel—long term. So he's not concerned about that now. And——
Crimea/Ukraine 
Q. Do you believe the issue of Crimea needs to be fully resolved?
The President. Say again?
Q. Do you feel the issue of Crimea needs to be fully resolved to mean the war is over?
The President. Seventeen other things need to be fully resolved too. Crimea is important, but there's much more to deal with. There's——
Ukraine 
Q. Mr. President, what sort of update did President Zelenskyy give you on how their counteroffensive is going?
The President. Well, I'm—I'm not at liberty to give you the detail of that. But it's—we talked at length about it with all his military people within there, and they're—they're still optimistic, but they know it's a hard slog. And so, any rate.
But I don't think it'd be appropriate to——
Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS)/Ukraine 
Q. Sir, are you thinking about sending ATACMS—the surface-to-surface missiles—yet? Is that something that is on your mind at all yet?
The President. Yes, but they already have the equivalent of ATACMS now. What we need most of all is artillery shells, and they're in short supply. We're working on that.
And so he seemed very, very satisfied with everything we're doing, when we left.
Turkey/Sweden/North Atlantic Treaty Organization 
Q. Are you confident—on Turkey—that Senator Menendez will drop his objections to sending the F-16s to Turkey?
The President. I'm confident that Turkey will continue to support Sweden getting into NATO. And I'm confident that we'll be able to sell F-16s.
Thank you.
North Atlantic Treaty Organization/Russia 
Q. And, Mr. President, after this summit and all the support that the NATO gave for Ukraine, and the G-7, what kind of message does this send to President Putin?
The President. We're together. We're together.
Thank you.

"July 11, 2023","Remarks Prior to a Meeting With President Gitanas Nauseda of Lithuania in Vilnius, Lithuania","
[President Nauseda's remarks were joined in progress.]
President Nauseda. And, first of all, I would like to remind you that we are celebrating one and—100 years of our establishment of our diplomatic relations. Also, our cooperation recently is improving all the time.
But I would like also to thank for the nonrecognition policy of the United States regarding the occupation of Lithuania in the Soviet Union. It was very persistent policy. It helped us—our spirit, moral spirit high. And I think this is very important to remember too.
The situation in our region is unfortunately deteriorating. And you see what is happening around us. And we see Belarus just swallowed into the Russian Federation, and we see that Belarus is becoming additional threat, additional factor of insecurity in the region.
So this is the reason why we asked the NATO—we asked our strongest ally, United States—to pay a consistent attention to the security of our region. And I think the NATO summit, which takes place in Vilnius, in absolutely near proximity to adversary countries, this is symbolic event—symbolic. But also, at the same time, this is a great opportunity to take the bold decisions, and we expect that they will be done.
This is very important to mention that we already have this Vilnius meeting as historical one, even before it started, because the membership of Sweden is already the—on the table. And I think we will welcome the 32d member of NATO very soon.
We have regional defense plans approved, and now it's important that they become executable by the end of this year, with prepositioning, with assigned forces.
We are probably—Lithuania is one of the most enthusiastic supporters of transatlantic bond in Europe—in European Union because we think that your participation, your attention is extremely important in this field of geopolitical uncertainty.
And at the same time, Lithuania is intending to buy—to acquire military equipment from United States. And I would like to mention Black Hawks. Also, we intend to buy HIMARS, JLTVs—Oshkosh. And all this military equipment helps us to modernize our military forces.
At the same time, we are closely cooperating with Germany. And recently, the very good decision was announced by Defense Minister Boris Pistorius to scale up the forward presence of eFP country Germany in Lithuania up to brigade size on a permanent basis. So I think it would be very positive to welcome this decision and welcome the engagement of all eFP countries in the region to increase the forward presence in our region.
So, Mr. President, thank you so much for your participation in our NATO summit. I'm looking forward to closely cooperate with you and with our colleagues during these 2 days. I'm looking forward to be able to listen to your speech tomorrow in Vilnius University. It will be another historical moment for Lithuania.
And all the Lithuanian people greet you so warmly. Even Vilnius, you see it's a little bit empty right now, but this is because of security restrictions, and some people decided to leave the city just to avoid some inconveniences. But you know, in our hearts—from bottom of our hearts, we welcome your visit, we welcome your arrival, and we are looking forward to cooperate with United States in the future.
President Biden. Well, Mr. President, thank you for the welcome, and thank your team as well.
You know, it's great to be back in Vilnius. I was here in 2014 as Vice President shortly after the Russian invasion of Ukraine the first time and, at the time, talked about what I thought Russia was likely to continue to do. Some people were somewhat skeptical of my judgment at the time and—but unfortunately, it turned out to be accurate.
And the United States is here today to reaffirm our commitment to NATO, but also to Vilnius. Look, we go back a long way. And the—when—we're committed to Lithuania and to the Baltics and to NATO.
I remember—you may recall when we were having the debate in the United States Senate about enlarging NATO, and I was arguing very strongly that the Baltics should all be a part of NATO. And you've been very, very added value.
And our pledge to be with you has not wavered. It didn't take us long to get thousands of troops here when Russia invaded the second time. We'll be able to—you can be assured that you're going to have all that you need.
We have the Secretary of Defense with us today. We can send him alone; he's enough. [Laughter] But all kidding aside, we—and look, as I've said before: We take, NATO takes, all of us take article 5 literally. One inch of NATO territory means we're all—we're all—in a war together against whomever is violating that space, and we're going to defend every inch of it.
And I want to thank you, Mr. President, for hosting this historic summit at an important time: the first time that NATO leaders will meet with 31 together, and looking forward to meeting very soon with 32 members, with the addition of Sweden. The leader of Sweden was just in my Oval Office not long ago, and we were hoping this would occur when it did. And I'm confident we'll get that done today.
And in the coming days, we're also going to discuss a range of issues—how to strengthen NATO's eastern flank and modernize NATO's deterrence and defense capabilities. And we're going to be doing it in a place of—where those—those efforts truly matter every single, solitary day. And we're also going to discuss our support for the people of Ukraine. And I want to thank you and—for your partnership and leadership as we take on this challenge together.
So I look forward to our conversation today and to continuing to stand with you and all the people of Lithuania for a simple reason: shared values. We have the same value set. It's important. That's what NATO is all about. That's what transatlantic alliance is about.
And as you probably heard, I am a very strong supporter of the transatlantic alliance. I've learned that nothing happens here that doesn't affect us. So we're all in.
We're looking forward to today. Thank you.
President Nauseda. Thank you.
Q. Mr. President—[inaudible]?
Q. Mr. President, when did you find out about Sweden? When did you find out that—[inaudible]—for Sweden?

"July 11, 2023","Remarks at an Official Greeting With Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in Vilnius, Lithuania","
Secretary General Stoltenberg. President Biden, dear Joe, welcome to the NATO summit. And many, many thanks for your strong leadership making this alliance united and even stronger. This summit is already historic because the agreement we made yesterday will make Sweden a full member of NATO. And that will make our alliance even more capable of defending all allies.
At this meeting, we will also send a clear message to Ukraine that we stand by them as long as needed and also that we agree on a united and positive message on the path forward for Ukraine and membership for Ukraine.
Another major message from this summit will be that we need to invest more in our defense. And we will agree on a new defense investment pledge where we state clearly that 2 percent of GDP for defense is the minimum.
And the good news is that European allies and Canada are stepping up. This year, we have new numbers showing that they have added 8.3 percent in real terms for their defense budgets. This is a record high, and that demonstrates that allies are delivering on their commitments.
So, once again, Mr. President, it's great to have you here at the NATO summit.
President Biden. It's good to be here. And thank you for continuing to deliver.
I—as I've made no—the press is not at all surprised that I've been touting the fact that I think it's really important at this critical moment in Ukraine—in the whole NATO issue that you continue to lead NATO. You're trusted. No one knows the situation that we're facing better than you do.
And this historic moment—the adding of Finland and Sweden to NATO—it's consequential. And your leadership really matters. And the—and we agree on the language that we proposed, that you proposed, relative to the future of Ukraine being able to join NATO.
And we're looking forward to continuing a united NATO. They've heard me say—my American press have heard me say many times I still think that President Putin thinks the way he succeeds is to break NATO. Not going to do that, especially with you as the lead of it.
So thank you for being willing to do it.
Secretary General Stoltenberg. Thank you so much.
President Biden. Thank you, thank you, thank you.
Secretary General Stoltenberg. Thank you.
President Biden. Thank you, all.
Q. Where do things stand—[inaudible]? Where do things stand—[inaudible]?

"July 11, 2023","Remarks Prior to a Meeting With President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey in Vilnius, Lithuania","
President Biden. Mr. President, it's good to see you again—delighted to be with you. And you know, we're at this historic summit meeting. We're resolving a lot of things, I hope.
And you made all the more historic by the agreement you reached yesterday in the admission of Sweden and how you're going to proceed. I want to thank you for your diplomacy and your courage to take that on. And I want to thank you for your leadership, Mr. President.
This summit is reaffirming our commitment to NATO defense with close allies in NATO, and I hope we can make it even stronger.
So, welcome.
President Erdogan. Mr. President, my dear friend, I would like to, first of all, thank you for congratulating me in the aftermath of my reelection to my current post. And I'm grateful for the congratulatory messages that you have extended to me.
And within the framework of our strategic mechanism, I think it's high time for the heads of states to get together for further consultations. That's why I believe today's meeting with you within the margin of the NATO summit is the first step forward.
Our meetings prior to this were mere warmups, but now we are initiating a new process. This new process is a process of 5 years.
And now you are getting prepared for the forthcoming elections. And with the forthcoming elections, I would like to take this opportunity to also wish you the best of luck.
President Biden. Thank you very much.
President Erdogan. Thank you.

"July 10, 2023","Remarks Prior to a Meeting With Prime Minister Rishi Sunak of the United Kingdom in London, United Kingdom","
President Biden. All the flowers bloomed.
Prime Minister Sunak. Well, Joe, welcome. It's great to have you here, back in Downing Street. I think—you've been here a few times before, I know, but your first time as President. So we're very privileged and fortunate to have you here. Thanks for coming.
Great for us to carry on our conversations, which we were having just a month or so ago, it feels like, in the White House, where we signed the Atlantic Declaration, the first-of-its-kind economic partnership, which I know we'll be talking about today: how do we strengthen our cooperation, joint economic security to the benefit of our citizens.
But also, we head from here to NATO in Vilnius, where we stand as two of the firmest allies in that alliance. And I know we'll want to do everything we can to strengthen Euro-Atlantic security.
But great pleasure to have you here
President Biden. It's good to be back. You know, we've only been meeting once a month. [Laughter] This is—we met in San Diego, Belfast, Hiroshima, Washington, here. And couldn't be meeting with a closer friend and a greater ally.
And we've got a lot to talk about, and I think we're doing well. I think we're moving along in a way that is positive, but our relationship is rock solid between the United States, Great Britain. And I look forward to our discussions.
Prime Minister Sunak. Yes, me too. Great to have you here.
Thanks very much.
Q. Mr. President, how was the call with President Erdogan?
Q. Do you plan to come back for the AI summit, Mr. President?
Q. Are you confident that you will be able to get approval from Turkey this week?
[As reporters were ushered out of the meeting, Prime Minister Sunak showed President Biden two coffee mugs on the small wicker table between them.]
Prime Minister Sunak. So, Joe, we've got these special mugs here. These are our special new Downing Street mugs.
President Biden. Oh, new Downing Street mugs.
Prime Minister Sunak. We—new mugs. So I'm hoping there's something in there.
President Biden. There is.
Prime Minister Sunak. There's tea in there; it's really—I'm assuming it's iced tea.
President Biden. Hear, hear.
[President Biden displayed his mug to reporters.]
President Biden. They're new Downing Street mugs.
Q. Mr. President, how was your call with President Erdogan?

"July 07, 2023",Remarks on Health Care Cost Reduction Efforts,"
The President. Thank you, thank you, thank you. Please, have a seat. You know, Cory, what you've exposed is something that I think we don't pay enough attention to in Government. And it's not necessarily about health care, it's just about being played for a sucker.
When I started to deal with junk fees relating to airline costs, ticket seats, baggage, and the like, I think even some of the folks working with me thought, ""It's not that big a deal."" But you know, in America—it sounds corny—but fairness is something we kind of expect. And I don't know anybody who likes being viewed as having been played for a sucker, taken advantage of. People are ready to meet their responsibilities.
But I think this is a big deal. It's a big deal. And I have to thank my staff—and I mean that sincerely—for focusing on the health care piece. I didn't know some of this. I thought I knew a hell a lot about health care and—[laughter]—no, I've been a significant——
[At this point, microphone feedback was heard.]
Sorry. [Laughter] I've been a significant consumer, and my family has as well.
But look, Cory, your story, it turns out, is a very familiar one to too many Americans. You try to do the right thing, only to get ripped off instead.
On too many nights, too many Americans lie in bed staring at the ceiling worrying what will happen if their spouse gets seriously ill; what will happen if something else happens to them. Do they have enough insurance? Will they have to—will they have to—how are they going to pay their medical bills? Will they have to sell their home?
If you can hold—a point of personal privilege, as we used to say in the Senate—I was telling my staff that I was raised—it was a middle class family. We weren't poor. We lived in a three-bedroom house with four kids and a grandpop, a split-level home, and my—""the boys""—quote, unquote—now, the princess, my sister, had her own bedroom—[laughter]—as she should have.
But the three boys were—there were four—there were two sets of bunks in the other room. And there was a closet that ran—as your walked down the—you walked up the stairs, you walk straight down the hall, you went into, quote, ""the boys' room""—the three of us. And on the left, there was a closet in that whole wall. My parents' bed, headboard, was against that—where that closet was.
And every once in a while, rarely, my—you could hear—you could hear sort of a restlessness going on. You know, like, the—just—and one morning, I get up, and I ask—I said, ""What's wrong with dad?"" He said that he just got word that his company said they're no longer going to pay for health insurance; doesn't know what they're going to do.
Well, you know, for all of you out there who—and there's so many people who still are in that circumstance. And talk about being deprived your dignity. Not being able to take care of your family if you don't have health insurance is, I think, one of the most consequential things that can happen to a person.
And so, you know, for all of you out there, I just want you to know: I get it. We get it. We have your back, and we're never going to stop fighting for you. And I promise you that.
You know, since I've been in office, we've been carrying out my economic vision——
[As more feedback was heard, the President moved the handheld microphone to a shelf on the podium.]
All right—[laughter]—been carrying out my economic vision to move—to move from trickle-down economics what—to what everyone on the Wall Street Journal—from the Wall Street Journal to Financial Times is calling ""Bidenomics."" It's about growing the economy from the middle out and the bottom up, and—because when that happens, the folks at the bottom have a shot. They get a chance to rise up. And the wealthy still do very well. It's not to hurt anyone at all.
But today's job shows that I think—jobs report—I think shows that Bidenomics is working. We added 200,000 jobs—I think 209,000 jobs last month. And all told, we've created over 13 million—I think it's 13,300,000 jobs—[applause]—in 2½ years. That's more than any President ever created in a 4-year term.
And, folks, the unemployment rate is below 4 percent for 17 straight months. Not since 1960 has that occurred. Inflation continues to fall. It's less than half of what it was a year ago. And the rate of Americans without health insurance is at an alltime low. Premiums for coverage under the Affordable Care Act are $800 less per person than before I took office. And that's Bidenomics.
Today I'm joined by health care advocates and leaders, many I've—if I started to name you all, we would be here all night. [Laughter] But I want to talk about key parts of my economic plan. We're protecting consumers and reducing health care costs without—without—in any way hurting insurance companies, docs, hospitals, or anybody else.
You know, in my State of the Union Address, I outlined our fight to end junk fees, the hidden charges for companies who seek—sneak into your bills things that you don't think you're going to pay for. Each year, those junk fees cost hundreds of dollars a month for tens of billion—for tens of billions of dollars, weighing on—down family budgets and making it harder for people to pay their bills.
Junk fees may not matter to the very wealthy—and it's not the wealthy's fault, by the way—but they matter to working folks in homes like the ones I grew up in.
Over the past few months—over the past few months, my administration has cracked down on junk fees across different industries: banking, hotels, concerts, tickets, airlines, cable, internet—and the internet.
And today I'm pleased to announce that we're making some progress on health care.
First, my administration is cracking——
[The President coughed.]
Excuse me—cracking down on junk fees for health insurance plans that are like the ones that are inexpensive, but too often stick consumers with hidden fees.
As Cory just talked about, junk fee plans are ""short-term"" health insurances that are supposed to provide a few months of temporary coverage for people who are moving from one plan to another. But the prior administration before me decided to let insurance companies make more money by selling junk plans that are up to 3 years long—up to 3 years long.
Americans thought they were buying temporary insurance that would provide real coverage in those plans. Instead, many have been saddled with thousands of dollars in medical bills these junk fees don't cover. And I think it's outrageous.
There are two main ways junk fees stick you with the high bills. The one way you just heard from Cory: He needed emergency surgery to get his appendix removed, but hidden in the front—in the fine print, his plan said it would only cover a fraction of the $37,000 the hospital bill was, even though he was paying his insurance premiums every month.
Another predatory way of getting around protection Barack and I fought so hard in the Affordable Care Act to accomplish, protecting millions of people with preexisting conditions, like cancer and heart disease. That was a way to get around that.
Just imagine if you had a heart attack and you expect your insurance company to pay for it, or you're diagnosed with a cancer and you expect your insurance company to pay for it. But they dig into your medical records, discover you had asthma as a kid, claim you had a heart attack was a preexisting condition, and then refuse to pay.
Folks, that's not health insurance, that's a scam. That's a scam. It has to end.
And, folks, today my administration is issuing a new rule that would close the loophole that allows these junk insurance plans to exploit Americans. Under our rule, ""short-term"" plans would have to be short term. That means 4 months or less, not 3 years. Insurance companies would also be required to provide a clear disclaimer upfront about what's covered and what is not covered, instead of burying it in fine print.
Second, we're cracking down on surprise medical bills, which I thought we had made some progress on. You've already heard stories about people who choose a hospital that's in their insurance network and they get a surprise bill for thousands of dollars because the hospital assigned them an anesthesiologist who wasn't in their network without them knowing that.
In January 2022, we ended surprise medical billing so hospitals that are in-network can't send you a surprise bill for an out-of-network doctor that you did not choose or even know he was consulted.
And over the past 18 months, we've protected 1 million Americans every single month from these surprise bills. But these are bills that cost people hundreds of thousands of dollars.
But get this: Some health care providers are trying to get around the rule by putting in place a—the rule we put in place by prevent—to prevent the surprise billings. The travel industry figured out how to charge customers $90 a night in resort fees for hotels that aren't resorts. [Laughter] You think I'm kidding. [Laughter]
Hospitals are trying to do something similar by using different designations to charge their higher out-of-network rates or charging hidden facility fees for going to a doctor's office in the building owned by the hospital.
And some hospitals are working with credit card companies to promote medical credit cards. Sounds good. Consumers can use these cards to borrow the money to pay for the procedures and get charged, but—in the hospital—but they get charged higher interest rates as a result of that. It's wrong. It's wrong.
Today my administration is closing these surprise billing loopholes. Evading the law and playing games to charge patients outrageous prices has to end. It has to end.
And, folks, we're putting a stop to insurance companies gaming the networks and making them reveal any hidden facility fees. They've got to reveal them.
And for the first time in history, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Treasury are teaming up to investigate whether health care providers promoting medical credit cards are violating Federal law.
Third—[applause]. Third, we're lowering prescription drug prices for seniors and people with disabilities. With your help, I signed into law the Inflation Reduction Act. Among the many important things it does, it finally gives Medicare the power to negotiate lower prescription drug prices like the Department of Veterans Affairs does now.
We've been trying to get this done for decades. I don't know how many times I made this speech on the floor of the United States Senate. [Laughter]
Audience member. Many.
The President. Along—[laughter]—yes, many—[laughter]—along with many others, but now. [Laughter] And this time, we finally beat Big Pharma. Seniors on Medicare who were paying as much as $400 a month for insulin are now paying $35 a month.
And I might add—[applause]. I might add: The guy who invented the insulin—the guy who invented it, he didn't even patent it because he thought everybody should have access to it. It costs $10 to make. To package it may be as high as $13. They're still making three times what it cost them. It's not like they're being cheated.
You know, we also closed [capped; White House correction] the total out-of-pocket drug costs for seniors on Medicare at $2,000 a year, even for expensive drug costs like cancer drugs that are $10-, $12-, $14,000 a year.
Today the Department of Health and Human Services released a report showing that when these provisions go into effect—it's not—they don't go into effect until 2025—one in three Medicare beneficiaries—that's nearly 19 million people—will save an average of $400 a year.
Seniors with the highest drug costs will save an average of $2,500 a year. This is going to reduce out-of-pocket spending by Americans by nearly $7.5 billion annually. And guess what? It matters.
When we were negotiating the issue on whether the Government is going to stay open, I spoke to some of my MAGA Republican friends. It not only—it not only—saves the consumer, it saves every taxpayer. [Laughter] You're not paying that extra $7 billion because Medicare doesn't have to take the out-of-pocket and pay it.
Last week, the Centers for Medical [Medicare; White House correction] and Medicaid Services released the final guidance on how they'll negotiate with drug companies to lower prescription drug costs. On September 1, I'll announce the first 10 drugs selected for negotiation under the law.
This will not only save consumers money, it's going to save the Federal Government money, as I just referenced. Negotiating drug prices alongside other parts of my prescription drug plan is going to save the taxpayers so far $160 billion—$160 billion.
It lowers drug costs of prescription drugs, and it lowers the deficit. It lowers the deficit. And I might add: All the talk about I'm ""Big Spendin' Biden,"" I lowered the deficit—[laughter]—1 trillion 700 billion dollars in the first 2 years. No one has ever done that. The last guy increased it by 40—anyway, I won't go into it. [Laughter]
Well, that's Bidenomics in action. [Laughter]
But guess what? Big Pharma doesn't want this to happen, so they're suing us to block us from negotiating lower prices so they can pad their profits while hard-working Americans foot the bill.
But what we're going to—we're going to see this through. We're going to keep standing up to Big Pharma. And we'll also stand up to MAGA Republicans who have been trying for years to get rid of the Affordable Care Act. They've tried 70,000 times, I think.
To deny Americans—to deny Americans—access to the Affordable Health Care Act—on my watch, health care is not a privilege in this country. It should be a right.
And, folks—[applause]—but let me—let me close with this. When I ran for President, I promised I would not continue the trickle-down economics of the past, because here's the simple truth: Trickle-down economics represented the moment we walked away from how this country was built in the first place. Bidenomics is just the other way around: restoring the American Dream.
Forty years of trickle-down economics limit the dream to those at the top. I believe that every American willing to work hard should be able to get a good job, afford good health care no matter where they live, in every part of the country, if they're willing to work.
That's the American Dream. That's Bidenomics.
And that's why I can honestly say I've never—I really have—I—know I don't look like it, but I've been around a while. [Laughter] But all kidding aside, I've never been more optimistic about America's future than I am today. I really mean that. I genuinely mean that.
We just have to remember who in God's name we are. We're the United States of America. There is nothing, nothing beyond our capacity if we work together. There's not a single major problem we've decided to solve as a country together that we've not succeeded in doing. Not a single one.
So why are we stopping now? There's so much opportunity. And because of all of you and the minds and the courage that you all represent in this room—I really mean it—there's no reason why we can't continue this.
And by the way, we're going to be fair. The suppliers, the drug companies, they're still going to do very well. Everybody is going to just do fine. I'm just tired of seeing Americans ripped off.
God bless you all, and God protect our troops. Thank you.

"July 06, 2023","Remarks on the National Economy in West Columbia, South Carolina","
The President. Hello, South Carolina!
Thank you, Nikki, for that——
[At this point, the President tried to move the podium riser in.]
——if you wonder what I'm kicking here, I'm kicking this stand in. [Laughter] But it's not working.
[The President moved the riser out of the way with his foot.]
How about that? All right, maybe I stand on it and give my—I'll be 6'4"". [Laughter]
Folks, thank you—[inaudible]—for being here. And I want to particularly thank my good friend Jim Clyburn. The truth of the matter is—all of you know it in South Carolina—I wouldn't be standing here were it not for Jim Clyburn. [Laughter]
Jim has been one of the most consequential leaders in South Carolina history, in my view. He's tough, he's loyal, he's principled. And—and he let me—I want to tell you something: If he has your back, you—he always has your back.
And, Jim, it's good to be back in your home with you and your daughter.
And look, former Mayor Steve Benjamin couldn't be here today—and you all remember Steve as your mayor—because he's traveling with his family. And it's great to have him here—have him part of our team. But his mom and dad are here.
By the way, if you have seats, sit down. [Laughter] I'm sorry. I once said, ""Everybody take a seat,"" and there were no seats. They said, ""Biden is so stupid, he didn't know there were no seats."" [Laughter] Anyway.
Also want to thank the leadership of Enphase and Flex for hosting us.
You know, I'm here to talk about what we're doing to invest in America—and I mean invest in America, all of America, starting here South Carolina—and to talk about the progress we made in building an economy from the middle out and the bottom up, not trickling down. When the—when you build from the middle out and bottom up, everybody does well, and the wealthy still do very well. With that trickle-down economy, not a whole lot dropped on my dad's kitchen table growing up.
It's all part of an economic vision for this country. I came to office determined—to the point of—some on my own team thought I was too determined—to change the economic direction of this country, to move trickle-down economics and get rid of it for everyone, from—the Wall Street Journal to the Financial Times called the program ""Bidenomics."" I'm not sure they meant it as a compliment at the time. [Laughter]
Our plan is working. And one of the things I'm proudest of is that it's working everywhere, not just in the coasts and big cities, like previous recoveries. This time, investment is working—and factories being built and jobs being created—happening in rural America, the heartland, all across America, in communities that have been left out and hollowed out.
This is what it looks like across the country. Over 13 million new jobs since I've been elected to office, more jobs than any President's ever created in their first 2 years. Nearly 800,000 manufacturing jobs, including 14,000 in this State alone—this State alone. And again, that's more—that's more in 2 years than was created in 4 years in any other administration.
Unemployment has been below 4 percent for the longest time in 50 years. Inflation is less than half of what it was a year ago, and we're continuing to work on it.
You know, I know we have more to do. Bringing down inflation remains one of the—my top priorities. Job satisfaction nationally—nationally—is at a 36-year high. The share of working-age Americans in the workforce is as high as it's been in 30 years. Remember they used to say, ""Biden is spending all this money to keep people from working""? People are off the sidelines. Twenty years—twenty years high—higher than every single one of my predecessors.
And to pay for low-wage workers—the pay for low-wage workers has grown at the fastest pace in two decades. And, folks, it's no accident. It's Bidenomics in action.
Trickle-down economics has failed the country for decades. It means slashing public investment on things that helped America lead the world in innovation. You know, we used to invest 2 percent of our entire gross domestic product in research and development. You know what it is now? Point-7 percent.
We used to be ranked number one in the world in research and development. Know what we're ranked now? Number nine. China was number eight a decade ago, and now China is number two. And other countries are closing in fast.
This is the United States of America, for God's sake. We used to have the fastest—the best infrastructure in the world, rated number one. Now we're rated number 13 in the world in infrastructure. How can you have the best economy in the world and not have the best infrastructure in the world?
Under my predecessor, Infrastructure Week became a punchline. Every—every—every month—anyway. It's just—I won't get into it. [Laughter] On my watch, we're making infrastructure a decade headline. A decade.
Yesterday, we announced that since I took office, we have attracted a half a trillion dollars—$497 billion—in private investment in American manufacturing, both here and around the world. It's historic, and it's Bidenomics in action. Instead of exporting jobs to cheaper labor costs—what we did for decades—we're creating jobs here and exporting American product. Product, not jobs. That's the story here in South Carolina.
Earlier, we heard the leadership of Enphase say that $60 million they're investing here. Well, that's 1,800 jobs across the country and up [to; White House correction] 600 permanent jobs right here in South Carolina, all a direct result of the so-called Inflation Reduction Act I wrote—we wrote and passed.
Well, that's the legislation that passed where so much money is coming in to make all this happen. And by the way, parenthetically, I want you to—you're going to hear about the deficit—I cut the deficit $1.7 trillion in 2 years. Nobody has ever done that. Cut the debt 1.7. This generates income. It generates growth.
Enphase first commercialized the component that converts solar energy into electricity. All that solar energy doesn't do a whole lot of good if you can't do it and convert it into electricity. It's called—they invented a thing called a solar microinverter.
Jobs that used to go to Mexico, India, Romania, and China are now coming home to South Carolina. Now Enphase is partnering with Flex to make these parts here in South Carolina. And today, they're shipping their first microinverters made in America. Made in America.
And the good news is 90 percent of these jobs require intelligence but don't require a college degree. And Flex is working with Midlands Tech—Midlands Technical College in Columbia to develop training and pathways so folks can get these jobs.
Since I took office, we've seen over 60 domestic manufacturing announcements all across the solar supply chain. One of the biggest is in Dalton, Georgia. You may find it hard to believe, but that's Marjorie Taylor Greene's district. [Laughter] I'll be there for the groundbreaking. [Laughter]
Look, and just today the Department of Energy announced new incentives for companies to bring solar power manufacturing back to our shores. We're in a real race; China is ahead of us. This is another step in helping us meet the goal of a hundred percent clean, renewable energy—electricity by 2035. By 2035, all electricity in America is going to be generated by clean energy—that's a big deal—and saving billions of tons going into the air of pollution.
We see the same story in semiconductors, those small, little computer chips the size of the tip of your finger that affect nearly everything in our lives, from your cellphone to automobiles and refrigerators to the most sophisticated weapons systems. They need these.
And guess what? America invented these chips. We're the ones that invented them. We sophisticated those chips. We made them what they are.
But over time, we went from producing nearly 40 percent of the world's chips down to less than 10 percent. That's why we designed and I signed the CHIPS and Science Act—all these names don't mean much until you know what they produce—because I knew we had to reclaim America's leadership.
Now, all over the country, semiconductor companies are investing a record hundreds of billions of dollars to bring chip production back home in Ohio, New York, Arizona, all across the—like outside Columbus, Ohio, Intel is investing, in a thousand acres outside of Ohio, $20 billion. Twenty billion. It's going to take 7,000 people to build the two—they call them ""fabs""—factories. And it's going to take 5,000 permanent workers.
Near Syracuse, Micron is investing up to $100 billion over the next 20 years, beginning now. In Phoenix, Arizona, TSMC is investing $40 billion, producing thousands of good-paying jobs.
As I said, for example, in Ohio, those 7,000 jobs building the facility are going to generate economic growth in that entire region outside of Columbus because they're generating—they bring along—you need storage, you need drugstores, you need a lot of things to maintain those jobs. And we're also seeing 3,000 jobs—those 3,000 jobs working in the fabs. You can make $100,000 a year. That's the average salary. And you don't need a college degree, making a hundred grand. The middle class—the middle class—this is a game changer, where ""Investing in America"" agenda is about bringing supply chains home, a clean energy future, made in America.
Before the pandemic, supply chains weren't something most Americans thought about. If I said to you 6 years ago, ""We're worried about a supply chain,"" you'd look at me like, ""Huh?"" Well, I would have looked at you the same way. But today, after delays in parts and products, everybody knows why supply chains matter. We know for too long China has dominated the production of raw materials needed for critical products. That's why we're building alliances with our friends all across the world, increasing our production here at home to create alternative sources for the minerals we need.
Our goal is to bring the full battery supply chain home. We create a ""Battery Belt"" stretching from Michigan to Georgia.
In Chester County, South Carolina, Albemarle is investing $1.5 billion to process lithium for electric vehicle batteries. That's not only will create 3,000—300 permanent jobs, but it will lift up a whole community—a whole community—restore some pride. It matters.
The lithium will power components like our—like the—like—it's going to be taking—being made in Redwood Minerals—excuse me—Redwood Materials near Charleston, where the company is making the largest investment in the State of—in the history of this State: $3.5 billion to build a battery materials manufacturing plant, creating 1,500 jobs. That's another community changer. It's a game changer.
And those materials will go into batteries that will be recycled by companies like Cirba Solutions, which is investing $300 million here in Richland County, creating another 300 permanent jobs. That's community after community after community there's been that change. And it's on its way. If you change enough communities, it's going to change the State, it's going to change the country.
In Jim Clyburn's district, Promega [Pomega; White House correction] Energy Storage Technologies is investing 279 billion dollars—million dollars—million—to manufacture batteries to store energy to power the grid.
Look, what do you think we'd have said that—if I came when I was here trying to get the nomination 3 years ago and I told you while—you know, while I was campaigning, that we'd see this kind of investment in South Carolina—billions of dollars?
I think you would've been a little skeptical. But that's why I fought so hard for the things I wanted to do. We didn't get much help from the other team, but that didn't stop us from getting it done. And that's going to transform America.
All told, since I signed the Inflation Reduction Act and the CHIPS and Science Act into law, companies have announced $11 billion in manufacturing and clean energy investments just in South Carolina. Eleven billion dollars.
Companies across the county—or, excuse me, across the country are expanding factories, building new ones, creating tens of thousands of good-paying jobs, most of which don't require a 4-year degree.
And when I say every job in America should be a good job, including a free and fair choice to join a union, I mean it.
Audience member. That's right!
The President. Every venture to manufacture clean energy technology would be made stronger by collective bargaining relationships. But that's up to you do decide.
It's not just—it's not just manufacturing. Through the bipartisan infrastructure law, we've already announced over 35,000 projects all across America, like the Brent Spence Bridge, which is a billion-dollar operation, over the Ohio River from Ohio to Kentucky.
And today, in New York, we're investing a record—a billion dollars to renew the Hudson Tunnel. You walk through that tunnel, it was built a hundred years ago. It's falling apart. You'll be able to go through it a hundred miles an hour instead of 30 miles an hour.
Up in Union County, South Carolina, we're rebuilding six bridges critical to moving people and goods across this region. Each bridge is over 60 years old with weight and volume restrictions that cause detours, congestion, and supply chain delays. The oldest one is where South Carolina 49 crosses the Tyger River. The biggest one is right here in Columbia: ""malfunction junction."" [Laughter] You all know it.
How many years you've been talking about fixing ""malfunction junction""? Well, now, thanks to Jim Clyburn and help from the infrastructure law, it's finally going to get fixed. It's going to get fixed.
And we're removing every single lead pipe in America. More than 100,000 lead service lines go into homes here in South Carolina. And they're a risk to everyone's health, including children, so it's time to get them removed and replaced.
We're building. We're helping Richland School District One here in Columbia purchase 16 new electric buses. Because, guess what? The diesel buses cause asthma. They cause problems. They cause additional problems.
You all remember, during the pandemic, that thousands of people in this State didn't have a connection to a high-speed internet, wherever—in their business or their home. Everybody now talks about, ""We're going to close that digital divide,"" that divide between those who have a reliable internet connection and those who don't.
South Carolina is receiving $1 billion to close that divide—[applause]—connecting every home and small business across rural America and rural South Carolina that doesn't have reliable high-speed internet.
Thanks to Jim Clyburn's Affordable Connectivity Program—fancy name, but it's real—that's saying that 359,000 South Carolinian families are already saving $30 a month on their internet bills.
Look, we're doing this in communities all over the country. You can see exactly where the money is going and whether you're affected in your community here by going to invest.gov. Click onto invest.gov, put in your location, and they'll tell you what's happening in your community. You'll all see projects we're delivering in communities all across America.
Look, implementing this legislation also has another transformative impact. All those Members of Congress who voted against it suddenly realize how great it is, and they're bragging about it. As my mother would say, ""God love them."" [Laughter]
I want to thank Senator Graham for voting for the bipartisan infrastructure law and the CHIPS and Science Act, but I wish he'd voted for the rest.
Every Republican Member of the Congress voted against the Inflation Reduction Act. Every one. Every Republican Member of the House in this State voted to repeal the clean energy provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act that—that attached—attracted all these jobs.
You know, and then, after that effort failed, the Republican Study Committee, which includes over three-quarters of the House Republicans, just released a plan to go at trying to repeal it all again. That hasn't stopped them, though, from claiming credit—[laughter]—now that billions of dollars and thousands of jobs are coming to the United States.
It's not unusual. The distinguished Senator from the State of Alabama, a former coach of the university, strongly opposed the bipartisan infrastructure law. He's now hailing its passage. He said, quote, ""Great to see Alabama receive critical funds to boost ongoing broadband efforts."" [Laughter] It is great. But that's alright, because I'm one of those guys who believe in conversion. [Laughter]
Look, folks, on a very serious note, when I ran, when I got elected, when I proposed these pieces of legislation, I made a commitment that I would be President for all Americans, whether their elected officials voted for the—the events or not—all Americans, whether you voted for me or not. And I've kept my promise.
In fact, some analysis have said that the laws I've signed are going to do more to help red America than blue America. Well, that's okay with me, because we're all Americans. Because my view is: Wherever the need is most, that's the place we should be helping. And that's what we're doing. Because the way I look at it, the progress we're making is good for all Americans, all of America.
Let me close with this. I'm not here to declare victory on the economy. I'm here to say we have a plan that's turning things around quickly, but we have a lot more work to do.
When I came to office, we had a fundamental decision to make: Would we continue down the trickle-down economic path—a policy that's failed us time and again—that grew inequality, that saw jobs shipped overseas, towns hollowed out?
When I ran, I promised we would not continue down the trickle-down path. But here's the simple truth about trickle-down economics: It represented a moment when we walked away from how this country was built.
Bidenomics is just another way of saying ""restoring the American Dream."" Forty years of trickle-down limited that dream to those at the top. But I believe that every American willing to work hard should be able to get a good job no matter where they live—in the heartland, in the small towns, in every part of this country—to raise their kids on a good paycheck and keep their roots where they grew up.
That's the American Dream. My dad used to have an expression for—growing up. My word. He'd say: ""Joey, a job is a lot—about a lot more than a paycheck. It's about your dignity. It's about respect. It's about being able to look your kid in the eye and say, 'Honey, it's going to be okay,' and mean it.""
That's Bidenomics. It's rooted in what always worked best for this country: investing in America. Because when you invest in our people, when you strengthen the middle class, we see stronger economic growth that benefits everybody.
I've long said it's never been a good bet to bet against America. And I can honestly say it's never been—I've never been more optimistic about America's future. We just have to remember who we are, for God's sake. We are the United States of America. There is nothing beyond our capacity if we work together. So let's continue to work together.
God bless you all, and may God protect our troops. Thank you.

"July 05, 2023",Remarks Prior to a Meeting With Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson of Sweden and an Exchange With Reporters,"
President Biden. Well, Mr. Prime Minister, it's great to see you. You're a valued, valued friend, and it's an honor to welcome you to the White House.
And Sweden is a capable and committed partner. Together, we're preparing our relationship for—even further, including advancing the bilateral partnership agreement we're talking about.
But we're also prepared for the NATO summit next week. And I want to reiterate: The United States fully, fully, fully supports Sweden's membership in NATO.
And the bottom line is simple: Sweden is going to make our alliance stronger and has the same value set that we have in NATO. And I'm really looking—anxiously looking forward for your membership.
And I know with that bilateral relationship, Sweden and the United States are taking on the challenges that matter most to our people, from taking on the climate crisis to preserving a free and open Indo-Pacific. So, across the board, we seem to be in agreement on most everything.
And we're stepping up to protect our shared democratic values, including providing security and humanitarian assistance to the people of Ukraine. And the generosity of the Swedish people has been extreme. You've done a great, great deal as the brave people of Ukraine defend themselves against Russia's brutality.
And together, our countries and companies are working in lockstep on emerging technologies, including—I want to thank you, Mr. Prime Minister, for your work on—to build a safe 5G and 5C network—6G networks.
And I want to thank you again for being here. We've got a lot to cover. And I yield to you, Mr. Prime Minister.
Prime Minister Kristersson. Thank you so much, Mr. President. Thank you so much. I really do appreciate to be here. Thanks for the kind invitation to come here. It is highly valued for us.
I believe that Sweden and the U.S., we share so many values and priorities since long, but not least right now. That goes for how to handle the war in Ukraine. I thank you for your leadership, the transatlantic unity that you have made so much to establish. That goes also to how to tackle the climate crisis, mitigating climate change. That goes for handling the transatlantic way the challenges that China creates for democracies.
And I also would like to say that we highly appreciate your strong support for Sweden's NATO accession. That means a lot to us. We do seek common protection, but we also do think that we have things to contribute with to be a security provider for the whole of NATO. So——
President Biden. That's clear.
Prime Minister Kristersson. ——I very much look forward to our talks here today. Thank you so much.
President Biden. Well, I'm looking forward to this getting finished because you're an extremely valuable and capable partner.
Prime Minister Kristersson. Thank you so much.
President Biden. So thank you.
Prime Minister Kristersson. Thank you.

"July 04, 2023",Remarks to the National Education Association Annual Meeting and Representative Assembly,"
The First Lady. Thank you. [Laughter] Hello, NEA.
Hi, Becky. How are you? And how's this year's RA going?
[National Education Association President Rebecca S. Pringle spoke via videoconference from the Orange County Convention Center in Orlando, FL.]
Ms. Pringle. Well, you know, there's nothing better I want to do than spend the Fourth of July with almost 7,000 of my closest friends. It doesn't get better than that, Jill! [Laughter]
Ms. Pringle. It just doesn't. Wow.
The First Lady. You know, Becky, I was listening to all of the questions and comments that the educators were making, and I have to say, I think I beat them all; I've just signed my new contract, and I think this is year 39 for me as a teacher.
Ms. Pringle. So that's fabulous. So, speaking of that, Dr. Biden, how do you, as an educator, use your summer—now, you don't really get—nobody gets a summer off, right? But you know, as you end one term and you start the next, how do you recharge yourself and prepare for that schoolyear ahead?
The First Lady. Well, I think like a lot of the members there, you know, I do some work, you know, during the summer and, of course, I have that other job that you know about. You know, but I always try to take a week or two to relax.
Ms. Pringle. Yes, keep doing that other job too, Jill. [Laughter] Yes.
The First Lady. So I catch up on the books that I've been wanting to read. You know, and I'm an English teacher, so, you know, I'm reading everything I can get my hands on. So, if you have any good suggestions, will you just text them to me? [Laughter]
Ms. Pringle. We absolutely will.
The First Lady. Okay. Because I'm——
Ms. Pringle. We're on it.
The First Lady. ——always looking for some good books. And you know, I go to the beach; I'll be going tomorrow. And I like to, you know, go for some bike rides and some walks.
But you know, even though I try not to think about the fall, I'm always thinking about how I can change my curriculum, and already, I've been reading the papers, looking for articles that I want my students to write about. So I think I'm very much—you know, we're all the same.
You know, I think that now, you know, it's about—we're almost—I hate it when people say July 4th, ""Well, the summer is half over."" You know, I hate to hear that because it's just like it's going so quickly.
But I know that we don't have much time left. So, you know, there's sort of a mix of sadness—right?—that the summer is going by so quickly, but I always look forward to the year ahead, and I'm always—you know, I'm already checking my rolls to see if my classes are full.
So—but it's good to join a group of people that know exactly how I feel: all of my fellow NEA members.
And you know, I knew that Joe would always be the education President, because he knows that our Nation's—you know, the success of our Nation starts with you, the educators who shape our students' lives.
And so, you know, we've invested so much in our schools and our counselors and our nurses and administrators who make them all successful. And as he transforms, you know, our economy, creating millions of jobs that are shaping the future, he knows that education is key to filling those critical roles.
And I want you to know that he hears you. You know, when I was listening, I—the things that I heard about—the gun control, the—you know, keeping our students safe, mental health in our schools, pay—the Biden-Harris administration is listening, and we hear you.
And we know that, you know, for most people, a high school diploma alone isn't enough to find a great career, but that doesn't mean that the only pathway to success is a 4-year college degree.
And as First Lady, you know, I've traveled this country, and I've met so many amazing educators who are helping students explore and find their passions. Starting in middle and high school, they're creating opportunities to learn about computers and electric vehicles and wind turbines. You know, this is the future.
They're helping young people find registered apprenticeships and dual enrollment programs, which means they start in high school and, even younger, middle school, and they start thinking about their careers and how they're going to get into those careers.
That's the Biden education pathway. And it starts with free, high-quality universal—totally—preschool and creates a kindergarten through 12th-grade experience that prepares our students for their next steps.
And it supports apprenticeships and provides 2 years of affordable community college, with avenues for students who decide, ""You know, maybe I want to go to a 4-year college, or maybe I don't."" But this is the future of our workforce, a future that all of you make possible.
And together, through the Biden education pathway, we can fundamentally transform what it means to make a living and make a life here in America.
And now, I'd like to introduce the man who will never stop fighting for you, who knows how important teachers and unions are to our students and to our country, my husband, the education president, Joe Biden.
The President. Happy Fourth of July. I'm Joe Biden. I am Jill Biden's husband. [Laughter]
Folks, let me start by saying educators have champions in the White House.
Jill reminds me—and I mean this sincerely—all the time, teaching is not just what you all do, it's who you are. It's who you are. And I know the last few years have been incredibly difficult. We ask so much of you. And I want you to know I see you, we see you, we thank you. And we thank you, Becky, for your leadership.
You know, I've often say—and you're tired of hearing me saying it, probably—but children are the kite strings—they're not somebody else's children—they're all our children—are the kite strings that lift our national ambitions aloft, and you hold those strings. You hold those strings. And our job is to make sure you have what you need to do what you do best.
That's why, through the American Rescue Plan, we delivered critical support for schools, including funding for afterschool programs, summer programs, hiring more teachers, counselors, school psychologists.
Folks, in fact, more than 80 percent of school superintendents say they're using those funds in the American Rescue Plan to help students recover academically and to address mental health crisis facing so many of our young people as a consequence of the pandemic.
We're going to be talking about the pandemic—our—those who succeed us—for a long time. It had profound impact, and it had negative impacts. And we're working like hell to make it—to overcome it.
Compared with before the pandemic, the number of school nurses is now up 22 percent, the number of school social workers is up 43 percent. But we're just getting started.
You know, we expect teachers to solve every problem—every problem.
We need to provide access to preschool for 3- and 4-year-olds so they get to classroom ready to learn.
And by the way, recent studies have indicated that if you start school—not—days—daycare, school—at 3 years old, no matter what your background is, no matter what home you come from, you have an incredible opportunity.
You all know all the data and statistics: that a kid going from a broken home and a tough circumstance is going to hear a million fewer words spoken by the time they get to first grade, or they're going to find themselves in a situation where they are—their vocabulary is considerably less.
Since I took office, we've added 100,000 public school teachers, and we're going to continue working to address the teacher shortage. It's critical. It's critical. [Applause] No, really. This is a national security issue.
It starts with paying teachers and educators what they're worth. We're making it easier for teachers to—[applause]—you've got it, kid. That's why I know how to say, ""Not labor, but unions—unions.""
We're making it easier for teachers to enter the field in the first place, which is why we're already helped nearly 20 States put in place registered apprenticeship programs. These programs give aspiring teachers the chance to train under experienced teachers, like all of you, while earning a paycheck and not having to take on more student debt.
Another thing we can do—[applause]—is—to help with the educator shortage is to reduce the burden teachers face paying back their loans. When I came to office, there was a program called the Public Loan Service Forgiveness [Public Service Loan Forgiveness; White House correction] program. It was a total mess. And this was designed, if you'd engage in public service, you can get your debt forgiven for education.
We forgave more student loans to teachers—we had to—they had to be engaged in public service—not just teachers, but social workers and others, police officers, et cetera. But the program was too complicated, too difficult to take advantage of. But Jill and I were determined to fix it, and we have.
Since I've been in office, there are now more than 615,000 teachers, nurses, police officers, and others, who have been able to get as much as—loans in that $42 billion forgiven so far. Forty-two billion.
And by the way, the program is still there. Go to—anyway, you ought to contact us to make sure you know exactly how to qualify, because you deserve that forgiveness.
Finally, as you know all too well, educators now find themselves on the front lines of gun violence. All your—some of your members talked about it, Jill talked about. With your help, we passed the most significant bipartisan gun safety legislation in 30 years, but it's not nearly enough.
I was one of those guys, early on, when I was a Senator, who helped pass the assault weapons ban. And we had to only—we could only get it for 10 years, and one of the Republican administrations got rid of it.
But Congress needs to step up, pass commonsense gun safety laws to protect our kids and educators.
And by the way, arming teachers is not the answer. Arming teachers is not the answer. Banning assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, extensive background checks—they're part of the answer. They'll make a big difference.
And one more thing: Let's stand with teachers and educators against politicians who are trying to score political points by banning books. Did you all ever think you'd be in a situation, in the United States of America, we're talking about banning books? And the people deciding who to—what books to ban? Come on. That's not who we are.
Let me close with this. So many of us are here, at least in part, because somewhere along the way an educator believed in us, helped us believe in ourselves.
I know that was the case for me in grade school, high school, and in college. I used to stutter very badly. I had teachers in grade school and then in high school who convinced me it couldn't define me, I wouldn't let it define me. And they helped me.
I had a professor at the University of Delaware who became one of my great—he's the reason I ran. I didn't think I could. I didn't think I should. And he'd talk—he said, ""Remember what Plato said, Joe?"" I'm trying to think, ""What the hell did Plato say?""
But what he said was—[laughter]—to paraphrase him, he said: ""The penalty good people pay for not being involved in politics is being governed by people worse themselves. Run, Joe. Run."" That's the power of a great educator. No, I really mean it. Think about—all of you had somebody—somebody in your education who was just there for you, gave you confidence.
We owe our Nation's educators so much. And I'm here to say, we have your back. We're committed to supporting all of you, just like you support the Nation's future and our children.
Folks, this Independence Day, we should be more optimistic than ever. We have to remember who we are. We're the United States of America. We have never, never failed to accomplish a goal we set out to accomplish when we've done it together.
There's nothing—nothing—beyond our capacity when we do it together. We've come out of every crisis—unlike any other nation in the world today, we've come out of every crisis we've faced at—in the past 247 years stronger than we entered that crisis. We're doing it again.
I've never been more optimistic than I am today. I really mean it. Never been more optimistic. There's so much we can do. We're on the edge. And the American people are figuring out what the other team is talking about, and they don't like it.
So, folks, happy Fourth of July. Thank you, thank you, thank you for everything you do.
May God bless you all, and may God bless our Nation's educators.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

The First Lady. Thank you, Chaplain Barkemeyer. And thank you to the USO for helping to make this event so special and for being such a great partner to my White House Joining Forces initiative that supports military and veteran families, caregivers, and survivors.
Secretary Austin, Charlene, my fellow military families, welcome to the White House!
All across the country and at bases around the world, people are gathering with family and friends to celebrate the birth of our Nation.
But even as we laugh with our neighbors and enjoy the parades and cookouts and fireworks, we can never lose sight of the freedoms that this day represents or the families who make that freedom possible, families like all of you.
You are the brave and the bold, and the nearly 1 percent of Americans who have made the choice to keep us all safe. You miss births and birthdays, graduation and weddings, because you choose to put our country's security above your own.
And you're the spouses and children who serve as well, saying goodbye to friends and jobs, losing sleep when your servicemember is away, putting your chin up and your shoulders back no matter what this country asks of you. We are so grateful for all that you do. And our thoughts are with those serving overseas.
As a military mom and as your First Lady, I am honored and proud to share today with you, and I'm proud to be part of this military family.
God bless our troops and their families, and have a happy Fourth of July!
And now, your Commander in Chief, my husband, President Joe Biden.
The President. Well, happy Fourth.
Audience members. Happy Fourth!
The President. Today we celebrate our independence. We celebrate our liberty and our freedom. And Jill and I are honored to spend the day with so many military families. You represent a link in the chain of honor that stretches back to our founding days. You are the sinew, the backbone, the reality of why we're who we are. Unbreaking. Unbending.
Throughout our history, you remind us that democracy is never, never, never guaranteed. Every generation must fight to maintain it. We must always cherish it, defend it, and strengthen it.
You know, as we remember the extraordinary country this is, I hope we all rededicate ourselves to the essential work of our democracy, which is to unify—to unify—unify this Nation, to see each other not as adversaries, but as fellow Americans.
And let us remember that. While other—while the other nations were formed based on things like geography, ethnicity, religion, America is the only nation in history founded on an idea—an idea. And that is that we hold these truths to be self-evident, that all people are created equal—all people—endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, among them life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
We haven't always lived up to those words, but we've never walked away from them. And today, and all days, we have to say clearly: We never will. We never will.
Folks, this year, we honor the 50th anniversary of the All-Volunteer Force—50 years; 75th anniversary of desegregating the military; and the 75th anniversary of women's official integration into the military, full blown.
I've had the great honor of appointing some military commanders—haven't I?—that are women.
Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III. That's right.
The President. Yes. [Laughter] A lot. Any rate—this is a great guy, by the way.
[At this point, the President gestured toward Secretary Austin.]
This is a great guy. He has incredible, incredible integrity.
And though we've made enormous progress as a nation, and that's due to the people of this Nation—the people of this Nation—not the politicians, the people—we just have to keep going. You know, we just have to keep the faith. And we just have to remember who we are. We are the United States of America. And there's nothing—nothing—beyond our capacity if we work together.
Ladies and gentlemen, we've come out of every single solitary crisis stronger than we went in for 247 years. That's not hyperbole, that's a fact. We're the only nation that has.
So, folks, happy Fourth of July. God bless you, and may God protect our troops.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

The President. Hello, folks.
Q. Hello, President.
The President. There you go, Mr. Secretary.
Let me begin by saying I know there are millions of Americans—millions of Americans—in this country who feel disappointed and discouraged, or even a little bit angry, about the Court's decision today on student debt. And I must admit I do too.
Before I tell you the steps we're going to take, I wanted to talk about what we've been able—I want to talk about what we've been able to achieve so far on student loan over the past few years.
First, we made the largest increase in Pell grants in over a decade, helping students from families who nearly all make less than $60,000 a year. Then we fixed the so-called—with the help of the department—Public Service Loan Forgiveness program so that borrowers who got into public service—such as schoolteachers, police officers, social workers, servicemembers—you know, they actually got the debt relief they're entitled to under the law.
Before I came to office, only 7,000 people had benefited from that program. Today, over 600,000 borrowers have received relief from that program. And it's still available. So many people more—so many more people can be helped. And I encourage you to apply, if you haven't already. You're still eligible. Go to studentaid.gov. It matters.
Third, my administration improved a program from the Obama-Biden administration on Income-Driven Repayment Plan. That's what it was referred to as. Back then, we set a limit: Student borrowers would pay no more than 10 percent of their disposable income to pay back their debt in any 1 month—time.
My administration is going to reduce that to 5 percent. It's now the most generous repayment program ever. No one with an undergraduate loan today or in the future, whether from a community college or a 4-year college, will have to pay more than 5 percent of their disposable income to repay their loan. And that's income after you pay for the necessities, like housing, food, and the like.
The typical borrower is going to save about a thousand dollars a year. And if you keep up payments for 20 years without missing them, your total debt is forgiven after 20 years. That's what the program was before, but we've just reduced it 5 percent.
In addition to that, last year, I announced my student debt relief plan, a plan that was on the verge of providing more than 40 million Americans with real debt relief: up to $10,000 for many borrowers and up to $20,000 for those who had gotten a Pell grant. Nearly 90 percent of their relief would have gone to borrowers—90 percent of it—making less than $75,000 a year. And no one—no one—making over $125,000 would qualify.
This program was all set to begin. The website had been set up. The applications had been simplified so that it took less than 5 minutes to complete. Notices had been sent out to people about the relief they were eligible for. Sixteen million people—16 million people—had already been approved. The money was literally about to go out the door.
And then, Republican elected officials and special interests stepped in. They said no—""no""—literally snatching from the hands of millions of Americans thousands of dollars in student debt relief that was about to change their lives.
You know, these Republican officials just couldn't bear the thought of providing relief for working class and middle class Americans. Republican State officials sued my administration, attempting to block relief, including for millions of their own constituents. Republicans in Congress voted to overturn the plan. I think every one. I don't think I had any Republican votes for this plan.
At the same time, think about this: We all supported the Paycheck Protection Program—remember?—PPP—you know, which was designed to help businessowners who lost money because of the pandemic. It was a worthy program.
But let's be clear: Some of the same elected Republicans, Members of Congress who strongly opposed giving relief to students, got hundreds of thousands of dollars themselves in relief—Members of Congress—because of the businesses they were able to keep open.
Several Members of Congress got over a million dollars. All those loans were forgiven. You know how much that program cost? Seven hundred and sixty billion dollars. My program is too expensive? Three hundred and sixty billion dollars more than I proposed in my student debt relief program.
I was trying to provide students with $10- to $20,000 of relief. By comparison, the average amount forgiven in the PPP—the pandemic loan program—average amount forgiven was $70,000.
Now, a kid making 60,000 bucks, trying to pay back his bills, asking for $10,000 in relief—come on. The hypocrisy is stunning. You can't help a family making 75 grand a year, but you can help a millionaire and you have your debt forgiven?
My plan would not only have life—been life-changing for millions of Americans, it would have been good for the American economy. Freeing millions of Americans from the crushing burden of student debt, more homes would have been bought, more businesses would have been started, more couples would have had the confidence to start a family. Millions of people would have felt they could get on with their lives.
These Republicans blocked all that. Now, in addition to the hypocrisy, some of these Republicans in Congress are shamelessly pushing to advance a bill in the coming weeks that gives hundreds of billions of dollars in tax breaks and handouts to the wealthiest Americans. They still haven't given up on making permanent a $2 trillion tax cut that they never paid for. Never paid for. Two trillion dollars.
So let me be clear: For Republicans in Congress, this is not about reducing the deficit, it's not about fairness and forgiving loans, it's only about forgiving loans they have to pay. Today the Supreme Court sided with them. I believe the Court's decision to strike down my student debt relief program was a mistake, was wrong.
I'm not going to stop fighting to deliver borrowers what they need, particularly those at the bottom end of the economic scale. So we need to find a new way. And we're moving as fast as we can.
First, I'm announcing today a new path consistent with today's ruling to provide student debt relief to as many borrowers as possible as quickly as possible.
We will ground this new approach in a different law than my original plan, the so-called Higher Education Act. That will allow Secretary Cardona, who is with me today, to compromise, waive, or release loans under certain circumstances.
This new path is legally sound. It's going to take longer, but, in my view, it's the best path that remains to providing for as many borrowers as possible with debt relief.
I've directed my team to move as quickly as possible under the law. Just moments ago, Secretary Cardona took the first step to initially that—to initiate that new approach. We're not going to waste any time on this. We're getting moving on it. It's going to take longer, but we're getting at it right away.
Second, we know what many borrowers will need to make their hard choices, which their budgets are being strained now—when they start to repay their monthly loan payments this fall.
You know, we know that figuring out how to pay these added expenses can take time for borrowers, and they might miss payments at the front end as they get back into repayment.
Normally, this could lead some borrowers to fall into delinquency and default. But without their financial—it would hurt their financial security, and that's not good for them or the economy. That's why we're creating a temporary, 12-month, what we're calling ""on-ramp"" repayment program.
Now, this is not the same as the student loan pause that's been in effect for the past 3 years. Monthly payments will be due, bills will not go out, and interest will be accruing. And during this period, if you can pay your monthly bills, you should.
But if you cannot, if you miss payments, this ""on-ramp"" will temporarily remove the threat of default or having your credit harmed, which can hurt borrowers for years to come, because the Department of Education won't refer borrowers. And the reason why that will work: They won't refer borrowers who have missed payments to credit agencies for 12 months to give them a chance to get back up and running.
Let me close with this: Our Republican officials say, ""Student loan relief is a giveaway to the privileged."" You hear that loud now: ""the privileged."" [Laughter] I love their concern for the privileged.
But I know who student loan borrowers are in this country, and so do all of you: They're the couple putting off having a child until they can find their way to deal with their debt. That's who they are. They're a young—put—putting off buying their first home until they can get out from under their student loans.
Hope on the horizon thanks to the relief that I planned last year, today's Court decision snatched it away from them. I get it. I get it. I hear this. It's—and I'm concerned about it.
But today's decision has closed one path. Now we're going to pursue another. I'm never going to stop fighting for you. We'll use every tool at our disposal to get you the student debt relief you need and reach your dreams.
It's good for the economy. It's good for the country. It's going to be good for you.
Thank you very, very much for listening. We're going to get this done, God willing. Thank you.
Federal Student Loan Debt Relief Program 
Q. Mr. President, why did you give millions of borrowers false hope? You've dated—doubted your own authority here in the past.
The President. I didn't give any false hope. The question was whether or not I would do even more than was requested. What I did, I thought was appropriate and was able to be done and would get done. I didn't give borrowers false hope.
But the Republicans snatched away the hope that it was—they were given. And it's real—real—hope.
Thank you.
Q. Mr. President, will you cancel student debt?
U.S. Supreme Court/Presidential Authority 
Q. Mr. President, the Court said you overstepped your authority. Did you overstep your authority?
The President. I think the Court misinterpreted the Constitution.
Afghanistan 
Q. Mr. President, do you admit failure in Afghanistan? Mistakes? There was a report on the Afghanistan withdrawal, saying there was failure, mistakes. Do you admit there was mistakes during the withdrawal and before?
The President. No, no. All the evidence is coming back. Do you remember what I said about Afghanistan? I said Al Qaida would not be there. I said it wouldn't be there. I said we'd get help from the Taliban. What's happening now? What's going on? Read your press. I was right.
Thanks.
Q. So the report is from the State Department, actually, about the withdrawal.

"June 29, 2023",Remarks on the United States Supreme Court Decision on Affirmative Action in College Admissions and an Exchange With Reporters,"
The President. Good afternoon, folks. Sorry to keep you waiting a few minutes.
Forty-five years—for forty-five years, the United States Supreme Court has recognized a college's freedom to decide how to build diverse student bodies and to meet their responsibility of opening doors of opportunity for every single American.
In case after case, including recently, as—just as a few years ago in 2016, the Court has affirmed and reaffirmed this view: that colleges could use race not as a determinative factor for admission, but as one of the factors among many in deciding who to admit from a qualified—already qualified pool of applicants.
Today the Court once again walked away from decades of precedent and make—as the dissent has made clear. The dissent states that today's decision, quote, ""rolls back decades of precedent and momentous progress."" End of quote. I agree with that statement from the dissents—from the dissent.
The Court has effectively ended affirmative action in college admissions. And I strongly—strongly—disagree with the Court's decision.
Because affirmative action is so misunderstood, I want to be clear—make sure everybody is clear about what the law has been and what it has not been, until today. Many people wrongly believe that affirmative action allows unqualified students—unqualified students—to be admitted ahead of qualified students. This is not—this is not—how college admissions work.
Rather, colleges set out standards for admission, and every student—every student—has to meet those standards. Then, and only then, after first meeting the qualifications required by the school, do colleges look at other factors in addition to their grades, such as race.
The way it works in practice is this: Colleges first establish a qualified pool of candidates based on meeting certain grade, test scores, and other criteria.
Then, and only then—then, and only then—it is from this pool of applicants, all of whom have already met the school's standards, that the class is chosen, after weighing a wide range of factors, among them being race.
You know, I've always believed that one of the greatest strengths of America—and you've tired of hearing me say it—is our diversity, but I believe that. If you have any doubt about this, just look at the United States military, the finest fighting force in the history of the world. It's been a model of diversity. And it's not only been our—made our Nation better, stronger, but safer.
And I believe the same is true for our schools. I've always believed that the promise of America is big enough for everyone to succeed and that every generation of Americans, we have benefited by opening the doors of opportunity just a little bit wider to include those who have been left behind.
I believe our colleges are stronger when they are racially diverse. Our Nation is stronger because we use what we—because we are tapping into the full range of talent in this Nation. I also believe that while talent, creativity, and hard work are everywhere across this country, not equal opportunity. It is not everywhere across this country.
We cannot let this decision be the last word. I want to emphasize: We cannot let this decision be the last word.
While the Court can render a decision, it cannot change what America stands for. America is an idea—an idea—unique in the world. An idea of hope and opportunity, of possibilities, of giving everyone a fair shot, of leaving no one behind. We've never fully lived up to it, but we've never walked away from it either. We will not walk away from it now.
We should never allow the country to walk away from the dream upon which it was founded: that opportunity is for everyone, not just a few. We need a new path forward, a path consistent with the law that protects diversity and expands opportunity.
So today I want to offer some guidance to our Nation's colleges as they review their admissions systems after today's decision, guidance that is consistent with today's decision.
They should not abandon—let me say this again: They should not abandon their commitment to ensure student bodies of diverse backgrounds and experience that reflect all of America.
What I propose for consideration is a new standard, where colleges take into account the adversity a student has overcome when selecting among qualified applicants.
Let's be clear: Under this new standard, just as was true under the earlier standard, students first have to be qualified applicants. They need the GPA and test scores to meet the school's standards.
Once that test is met, then adversity should be considered, including its lack—a student's lack of financial means, because we know too few students of low-income families, whether in big cities or rural communities, are getting an opportunity to go to college.
When the poor kid—when a poor kid, maybe the first in their family to go to college, gets the same grades and test scores as a wealthy kid whose whole family has gone to the most elite colleges in the country and whose path has been a lot easier, well, the kid who faced tougher challenges has demonstrated more grit, more determination. And that should be a factor that colleges should take into account in admissions. And many still do.
It also means examining where the student grew up and went to high school. It means understanding the particular hardships that each individual student has faced in life, including racial discrimination that individuals have faced in their own lives.
The Court says, quote, ""[N]othing in this opinion should be construed as prohibiting universities from considering an application's [applicant's; White House correction] discussion of how race has affected his or her life,"" but it's—it's through—but ""be it through discrimination or inspiration or otherwise."" End of quote.
Because the truth is—we all know it: Discrimination still exists in America. Discrimination still exists in America. Discrimination still exists in America. Today's decision does not change that. It's a simple fact.
If a student has overcome—had to overcome adversity on their path to education, a college should recognize and value that. Our Nation's colleges and universities should be engines of expanding opportunity through upward mobility. But today, too often that's not the case.
The statistics—one statistic: Students from the top 1 percent of family incomes in America are 77 times more likely to get into an elite college than one from the bottom 20 percent of family incomes. Seventy-seven percent greater opportunity.
Today, for too many schools, the only people who benefit from the system are the wealthy and the well connected. The odds have been stacked against working people for much too long. We need a higher education system that works for everyone, from Appalachia to Atlanta and to far beyond. We can and must do better, and we will.
Today I'm directing the Department of Education to analyze what practices help build a more inclusive and diverse student bodies and what practices hold that back, practices like legacy admissions and other systems that expand privilege instead of opportunity.
Colleges and universities should continue their commitment to support, retain, and graduate diverse students and classes. You know, and companies—companies who are already realizing the value in diversity should not use this decision as an excuse to turn away from diversity either.
We can't go backwards.
You know, I know today's Court decision is a severe disappointment to so many people, including me, but we cannot let the decision be a permanent setback for the country. We need to keep an open door of opportunities. We need to remember that diversity is our strength. We have to find a way forward.
We need to remember that the promise of America is big enough for everyone to succeed. You know, that's the work of my administration, and I'm always going to fight for that.
And I want to thank you all. And I know you've been told I have a helicopter out there waiting to go up to do an interview in New York. I'll be talking to—more about this in a live interview.
But thank you very much. And we're going to have plenty of time to talk about this. But we're not going to let this break us.
Thank you.

"June 29, 2023",Remarks at a Campaign Reception in New York City,"
Thank you. Thanks. Thank you very much. I'm not the essential man, but I represent the essential company—country.
You know, remember Madeleine Albright talked about America being the essential country, the—America having to lead the world? I spent a lot of my time in foreign policy as a Senator and then as Vice President. And she was more right than I thought she was—that, you know, when I walk into a room, it's not Joe Biden walking into a room. It's the United States of America walking into a room.
And it has—no, I mean this sincerely. It surprised me how the rest of the world, in particular our allies—and not even our allies—look at the United States. They look at it like: We're in the house.
By the way, I've got to tell you, I had lunch with Barack the other day. And I was kidding him; I said, ""Every time I hear""—he's helping out a lot—I said, ""Every time I hear 'Hail to the Chief,' I turn around and look for you, wondering where the hell you are."" [Laughter] No, you think I'm kidding. I'm not. Secret Service looks at me sometimes like: ""That's you. Come on out."" [Laughter]
But, folks, there's—there's so much at stake. And I want to start by saying—it's not hyperbole—you're the reason why I've been able to get anything done on climate. Not a joke. Not a joke. You've held the country together in ways that we were ready to walk——
The first thing I did when I got elected was rejoin the Paris accord. First act we've—we took. And the impact it had on other nations was like, ""Whoa."" Not ""Joe Biden is back."" ""America's back in the deal.""
But you all have invested so much of your fortune, so much of your—of this—of the foundation you have in making sure that everybody understands this is the existential threat to humanity. It is the existential threat. Not a joke. 1.5 degrees Celsius, 19—205. We're in trouble if we get it—I mean, we're in real trouble. It's not going to turn this—for example, I was telling a couple of you earlier in the rope line—I'm sorry I spent so much time talking in the rope line, holding people up.
But you know, I was talking about how 2 years now—it'll be 3 years this Christmas—I was in Geneva trying to work out something with Putin, before he invaded Ukraine, on space-based weapons and trying to get a new negotiation going.
And he said—and I said: ""There's a lot we can work on. We can work on climate."" He said, ""We don't have a problem with""—he essentially said, ""We don't have a problem with climate in Russia."" I said: ""You've got eight time zones. The permafrost along the—along the Arctic Circle is melting. More methane is coming out of there than anywhere in the world. And guess what? It's not going to refreeze. You've got a real problem.""
The point is that just getting people to realize that—what is at stake. And you've done it.
And you've done it—the reason I'm standing here is in large part because of you all. Not a joke. I'm not being solicitous. I got a lot of help. I got a lot of help to get elected—a lot of people. But no group of people have been more engaged with me in terms of providing me the means and the judgment and the insight, like we were talking about what you're about to do.
I mean, it—there's just enormous possibilities, and I'm optimistic. I'm genuinely optimistic.
I just want to tick off a few things, and then I'll go to questions, because I don't want to take too much time talking about things you may not be interested in.
You know, first of all, you know, I—when I said—when I ran, I said I wanted to—I was running for three reasons. One, to restore the soul of this country. By that, I mean the value system we had, the decency, honor. I mean, think of the way we talk about—to each other now. I mean, it's embarrassing, in front of our children and our grandchildren. Not ""we""—the public dialogue. The things that are said. I mean, the language used. It's just—it just—it's degrading. And the rest of the world looks at us and goes, ""Whoa, what's going on?""
The first meeting I had after I became—elected President, I went to—the G-7 was meeting in—outside of London, along the coast. And I sat down. And with the press here, I'm not going to say who the people were. But I sat down with the other major leaders of NATO and Europe. And when—I said, ""America is back."" And one of the leading—CEO—not CEOs—Presidents of a country looked at me, and he said: ""For how long? For how long?"" Not a joke.
And I looked at him. And before I could answer, another leader from one of the major four countries in the world looked to me and said: ""Mr. President, what would you say if tomorrow we picked up the London Times and you've read that there was a circumstance where a thousand people broke down the doors of the House of Commons, killed two bobbies, and went in and tried to stop the election of a Prime Minister? What would you think?"" And it made me realize how profound what's happening here in the United States is to the rest of the world, how the—and what—what would we think? What the hell would we think?
And so one of the things that I was able to—I don't want to say ""I""—we were able to do was up the ante on climate across the board from all these—with all these countries and increase the number of countries participating.
Matter of fact, I have a—I don't want to get her in trouble—but a granddaughter working on this full time—working for one of the major institutions, traveling the world dealing with the G-7—these meetings on climate.
And there is an awakening. Let me put it this way: Since I got elected President, I've been in more helicopter rides with Governors from around the country—from Arizona, New Mexico, up to Washington State, to Idaho, all the way into Montana and down into—and more—more timber has burned to the ground because of climate change, because of the—of the winds and the storms knocking down high-tension wires and many other things, than makes up the entire square feet of the State of Maryland. That's how much has burned to the ground—to the ground.
And so, you know, all of a sudden, when you look out here and you can barely see a building across the lake—you know, sometimes it's going to—people are beginning to—there's no longer a debate, ""Is there global warming?"" ""Is there global warming?""
There's a selfishness saying, ""I don't—notwithstanding global warming, we still want to pollute.""
I mean, take a look at Texas. Texas has the highest percentage—I think it still does—of wind and solar. I think it may—I won't—I won't—I don't want to misstate, but a significant percentage of their energy is produced by wind and solar. But guess what? The Governor is trying to cut it back because the oil industry doesn't like it.
I mean—anyway. So I want to just quickly list the things we've been working on and then talk about whatever you want to talk about.
First of all, when I ran, I said we can—you know, we can get bipartisan things done. The press understandably said: ""You used to be able to do that, Joe. You were known for that.""
George Mitchell's friend is here. And George may—he gave me an award when I was a Senator, saying I got more done because I could have relations across the aisle with people and get things done. But they were the good old days. That's gone.
Yet we were able to get some bipartisan things done. Not with a big number, but just enough Republicans to join us. Some, we had to do it all ourselves.
But as I said, in addition to rejoining the Paris climate treaty, we passed the Inflation Reform [Reduction; White House correction] Act, the largest investment in the history of the world: $369 billion for climate—$369 billion. And remember they got mad I didn't get $500 billion?
Well, it cuts pollution by 1 billion tons, cuts emissions by 50 percent by 2030, and—and tax credits for EVs, solar, wind, and batteries, heat pumps, hydrogen. A lot of new—and there's a lot of research going on. A lot of you are funding the research. There are so many possibilities we have.
We passed the infrastructure law with 500,000 EV chargers. And they're going to—500,000. They can—and guess what? It's going to create a—we're capping 100,000 wells in the United States—100,000.
Remember all the heat about what was going on in West Virginia and—and south—west—Western Pennsylvania? Well, these same guys who dug those wells—guess what?—they're getting paid to cap them. And it's working.
And we're rebuilding. And we're putting a new environmental plant where that old steel plant used to be in—in Wharton, West Virginia.
Fuel economy rules. We cut emissions in half by 30—by 2032.
Brought unions—enviros—and enviros together. Did you ever think that would happen?
But I know some of you got worried about me after—when—about 2 months, when I hadn't announced my environmental stuff. You're calling, ""Joe, what the hell is going on?"" I said, ""I'm meeting with the union guys."" Because—no, I'm serious, because I was convinced that if they knew what was coming, their future lay with the environmental issues. That's how it—and by the way, the IBEW was the first one to stand up when I said: ""Hey, look, what are you doing? You're—you're going to be out of work. You're not—you're going to have trouble.""
But guess what? And we also—a couple of you were down on the South Lawn when I had all the automobile manufacturers together.
I remember the General Motors chairman had—was suing the State of California for having a higher standard than the Federal standards, saying that was unconstitutional and you couldn't have a higher standard. Well, guess what? A week and a half later, I got a call. She said: ""I'm dropping the suit in California, and I'm going to go all electric. All electric.""
And we started—and everybody started that route. And it worked. It's beginning to work. I mean, it's not finished yet by a long shot. But the point is, it's working. It's moving. And guess what? They all of a sudden figured out that's going to create all these jobs for them.
And by the way, these EV stations are going to be—these—you know, all across America. Electric vehicles—they're going to—they're going to put in 500,000 of these across the country. So you can get in your car, your electric vehicle, and go, just like an old gas station.
And that—and it's generating thousands of jobs. It will generate thousands more jobs in those communities. When you have a—when you—when they were building gas stations originally, no one wanted one in their neighborhood because they had thousand-gallon tanks in—back in the twenties and thirties.
Guess what? What happens when you build a gas station? You end up building a drugstore. You end up building a hotdog stand. I mean, it generates economic growth. And a lot of—and a lot of communities have been left behind big time and—because of what—shipping jobs overseas and—anyway.
So the third thing is—the last thing is that solar panel manufacturing is up eight times. You—a lot of you funded it. Solar energy and wind energy is now—now cheaper—cheaper—cheaper than fossil fuels. Cheaper to—no—and by the way, no one is going to bid on a coal-fired plant again. You know why? It's not—it makes no sense. Economically makes no sense anymore.
The biggest problem we had—and I need your help on this continually—is when I went up in—I guess it was Rhode Island—closing down the largest coal-fired plant in the country. Because what we found out was—and with the help of a lot of my staff—and they are good staff and environmentally conscious and smart—is that we—when Barack and I came up with the economic plan on—on the environment and energy and electric and dealing with wind and solar, we thought we could transmit it on the high power lines.
Well, not in my neighborhood. Even people that lived in your neighborhood didn't like it, and whether it was in—out in the—sound or wherever it was, because—and Trump didn't like it because it killed—it ""caused cancer.""
[At this point, the President made the sign of the cross.]
[Laughter] But all kidding aside, think about it. Think about what has happened since then. We figured out that if you close down those plants, you don't take down high-tension wires, you put the wind—you connect the wind or the solar to that facility.
So—and now what you're—a lot of you are helping doing: If we put these wires underground, it makes a—it costs six times as much, but it also is environmentally a hell of a lot more sound. Costs more. We're trying to figure out how to fund that as well.
But the point is, we're making significant progress. And the—and the EV sales are three times—up three times. And we've conserved—I announced when I got elected—and I'll stop with this—that my goal was to conserve 30 percent of all the land and all the waters within the jurisdiction of the United States of America and to do that by 2035—excuse me—by 2030.
So far, we're on our way. Now, we've got more to do in Alaska, and I need your help there. But we've—25 million acres is now in conservation in Alaska. Spirit Mountain, 500,000 acres—500,000 acres. The Pacific Islands, I'm going to—we're going to make sure that 770,000 square miles around Hawaii, off limits. Cut back on drilling in many places.
But the generic point is: There's a lot going on, and a lot going on in hydrogen. A lot going on in other alternatives. And it's because of you guys. And I'm not being solicitous. It really genuinely is.
You think it—I know you don't like to think about this way, but think if you all dropped out. Where the hell would we be? Not a joke.
You're funding the private enterprises you do in terms of environment, as well as making sure that you not only elect somebody like me, who cares about the environment, but a Congress—a Congress—a Congress. I need the Congress. I need the Senate. And we're going to do it. We're going to win back the House with your help. And we're going to—it's going to be hard to keep it in the Senate, but we're going to do that as well.
So I'm going on too much. I apologize. But there's an enormous—enormous—enormous—and the one reason why I am so optimistic is because of the people between the ages of 17 and 30. They get it. They understand. They are the impetus—the political impetus: the kids, the young people, the young voters.
I go into a grade school or high school; what do they want to talk about? The environment. They get it. They get it.
So there's a lot—a lot—we can do, and I'm optimistic we're going to continue to do it with your help.
I'm going to hush up, as my mother would say, and take any questions you have.

"June 29, 2023",Remarks at a Campaign Reception in New York City,"
The President. Governor, you should go home. [Laughter]
Governor Kathleen C. Hochul of New York. I love listening to—[inaudible].
The President. This is what we call a busman's holiday for your Governor. [Laughter]
And I want to thank you all very much. Blair, thank you. And—and, Roger, you guys, and Jon and Peter and Deven—you know, you've been a—you're the only reason I'm standing here, and that's not hyperbole.
These guys came along in twenty—two thousand and—in 2020, when we were running and we had hit the bottom. Things didn't look very well, as Roger I think pointed out to me just before South Carolina. [Laughter] And everything was looking bleak. And without even asking, you guys stepped up, and you saved me. You really did.
And I—one thing I wanted to say publicly with the press here is, it wasn't just the contributions; it was your stature. The fact that men and women of your stature stood up and vouched for me, it mattered. I mean, I—you all are used to helping people. You're used to helping political people who you think make a difference.
But I think you underestimate how much your personal status in the community means. You give credibility. And so I want to thank you for that. I—from the bottom my heart. And that's not hyperbole. I would not be standing here if you guys didn't volunteer. Without my even asking, you stepped up. So thank you, thank you, thank you.
And, Governor Hochul—Kathy, this is a—it's an honor to be with you. You've done a hell of a job. And being the Governor of New York is not an easy thing. But it's a big, beautiful State.
I think it's one of the most—I think it's the single most underestimated State in the Nation. It has the most beautiful—parts of this State are—I mean, it's incredible. And that comes from a guy who married a woman from the Finger Lakes and Lake Skaneateles.
But the point is that you've done a great job. And I want to—I appreciate—and I know that we've tried to work on some things together. We've done a lot together. But also, we're in a situation where the good Governor of Florida and Texas have not been the best friends of New York for a long time, and we're trying like hell to continue to help.
By the way, the number crossing the border is down significantly, from close to 80,000 to 3,500. And we're—I think we're—with the grace of God, the good will of neighbors, and the crick not rising—as my father would say—we're going to be—and by the way, you know, I have a lot of assets to this campaign, but none that are more consequential than Jeffrey Katzenberg. Jeffrey, thank you. Jeffrey has been—come along, and he's a cochair of my campaign. And he comes from—he comes from the West Coast to these things. You know what I mean?
Anyway, I—and I'm proud to call everyone here—in here that's sponsoring this a friend. And I mean it.
And look, you were with us when the things—when the pundits said we were counted out. And I want you to know, again, I'll never forget what you did for me. I would not be here without you. And I don't think that—I—in our private conversations when I got here initially, I mean, just a couple hours—an hour or so ago, is that this is a critical election, not because I'm running, because what's at stake. There's so much at stake. And the alternative is a little bit scary. I'm not being facetious.
I mean, the lack—did you ever think we'd be talking about banning books in America? Did you ever think we'd be talking about back in the—like the days in the—in the last century, we were talking about cutting voting rights, about making sure—gerrymandering the districts in ways that were—I mean, it just——
And the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court is becoming not just conservative, but almost—it's like a throwback. It's like a throwback, some of the decisions they're making.
You know, did you ever think we'd be in a position, after 50 years of acknowledging the right of privacy in the Constitution, suggesting that there—there's no such thing as the right to privacy? Did you ever think we'd be having arguments about whether or not contraception was legitimate—could be outlawed by States? I mean—I mean, it's like we're in a different world almost.
But I think that—I have faith, because I really think the vast majority of the American people are decent, honorable, and good, and they just have to get the facts. They have to get the facts. And that's one of the things that you're looking—I'm looking forward to you relying on me to be able to do.
And look, because we've got a story to tell and a record to run on, I think with a little bit of help, we can do well this time out. I think that—you know, yesterday I talked to Chicago about what the press—not—I—and I—it wasn't necessarily meant to be so complimentary, but Bidenomics, by the—you know, the Economist and the Wall Street Journal, et cetera. And I'm not criticizing it. You know, they just—but I come from a circumstance where I think that the best thing we can do for American growth, and we have—when we win the most—when we've been the most secure and powerful is when the middle class was able to participate. When we still had very wealthy people like all of you leading the way in many ways, but trickle-down economics never landed much on my dad's kitchen table.
And so we found ourselves in a situation where the excesses of that program, of that notion, were seen last time around: a $2 trillion tax cut and not a penny paid for; greater increase in the debt than anybody in—anybody. And you know, 40-percent increase. I mean, things that we—a tax system that is—I mean, it's just not—it's just not fair. It's—I don't know many people who think it's fair.
And I'm not looking for 60- or 80-percent taxes for wealthy people. We're not going back there. But just everybody pay their fair share.
I'm a capitalist. If you can make a million dollars, a billion dollars, that's fine by me. Just participate. And you all do. You all do.
But you know, we have—we've gone from—in America from having 750 billionaires 4 years ago to—to now a thousand, average tax rate 8 percent. That's less than—that's less than a cop pays, a firefighter, you know, someone running a childcare center.
And so one of the things that I've done is that I've decided that you've got to—the best way to build a country is—and Bidenomics wasn't meant as necessarily a compliment at the time—is to let people know what I believe. I think it's a different value set: that is to build this country from the middle out and the bottom up. The poor have a shot when that happens. The middle class does well. We all do well. And the wealthy don't get punished at all; they still do very well. And so I think that's what's starting this—people are beginning to see—to see that again.
And you know, yesterday, as I said, I talked in Chicago about making investments in America, educating and empowering our people, promoting competition.
You know, I met with some of you who are a part of the Business Roundtable. I met with the Business Roundtable, and I—they're asking me why I was talking so much about—about education and—and funding of preschool and all that kind of thing. And I said, you know, when the former—the Governor of Illinois—his sister was Secretary of Commerce, Barack asked us to meet—and I think you may remember this—with—I think we met with either in Zoom or in person with 400—or 350—don't hold me to the exact number—over 350 CEOs of the Fortune 500 companies.
And we asked them, ""What do you need most?"" They said, ""A better educated public, a better educated workforce."" And I said, ""You know, I come from the State of corporate America, more of you are incorporated in my State than every other State in the Union combined."" And I said, ""Back when I ran the first time and got elected as a 29-year-old kid in 1972 to the Senate, the DuPont company was the eighth largest corporation in America."" It's no longer, but it was. And I said, ""When they'd—when they'd expand and buy a new enterprise, they'd educate their—they'd educate their workforce."" I said: ""You guys don't do that anymore. So why the hell are you taking me on when I'm trying to get a better educated public?"" And it changed. People started supporting it.
But my generic point is that there is—there's—I think there's beginning to be a bit of a sea change. You know, the idea that we were able to—when I ran, I said I wanted to—I wanted to bring back—restore the soul of America. That wasn't hyperbole. It was to try to bring back a sense of decency and honor in the way we talk to one another, the way we conduct policy.
You know, the—I just came from a function in town here. And George Mitchell's—I think it was his niece—and George Mitchell was—was the Senate Majority Leader. And he—when—anyway, he was very generous in the caucus in saying that Biden was able to get things done better than anybody else since Kennedy because I had relations with the other side of the aisle.
And I did. We used to argue like hell. John McCain and I would scream at each other, but we were like brothers. We'd make up at the end, and we worked together when we agreed on things. You remember these conversations.
And I said—and they said: ""Well, that was the old days. Biden doesn't realize that all's changed. You can't do that anymore.""
So what I said was I wanted to—I wanted to bring back some bipartisanship. With your help, guess what? We passed more major legislation than anybody—I'm told by Jon Meacham and others—more than any other President since Franklin Roosevelt, major pieces of legislation. And it was with—and about half of it was bipartisan. Bipartisan. Not a lot—because this is not your father's Republican Party. This is a different breed of cat. But there's still a lot of really honorable, decent Republican Senators and Congressmen. They're mildly intimidated by some of the MAGA-right folks in the new Republican Party.
But the point is, we got a lot done. And—for example, the end result was that we're making—by empowering and educating our people, promoting competition. It's working. Thirteen million jobs created. We inherited a mess. Inflation less than half of what it was just a year ago; $490 billion foreign—$490 billion in private investment in the economy in the United States of America.
Remember the talk was, at the time, ""Biden is trying to establish industrial policy""? We did a survey. Don't ask me how many folks they asked—my staff. But went out and asked and said, ""Are you more or less inclined to make major investments in the economy if the Government is investing?"" And it was like 80 percent more. And guess what? It's working.
That's why I went out and did the CHIPS—you know, when I—we worked on the legislation relating to semiconductors. We invented those suckers, man. Smaller than the end of my little fingertip. We were sophisticated. We're the ones that did it. And guess what? We used to have 40 percent of the market. Now we have less than 10 percent of the market.
And so I went around saying there was a way to come to the United States and invest: $300 billion that's beginning to be invested right now—Syracuse, New York, up in Poughkeepsie and those area—not Poughkeepsie.
Audience member. In both.
The President. Both.
Audience member. [Inaudible]—and IBM.
The President. And, I mean, they're investing a great deal. You know, I—the first major initiative was Intel, outside of Cleveland, Ohio. A thousand acres that are being developed. I started calling—well, I—it was spontaneous. I—maybe people thought I had a plan. I said it's the ""field of dreams."" These guys are building two fabs—two factories—that are bigger than football fields, each of them; going to apply—employ 5,000 people. And guess what? Seven thousand people building them on prevailing wage. A lot of growth in the region just for that. But those folks, the vast majority of those jobs are more than 1,000—100,000 bucks a year, up to 130 grand a year. And you don't need a college degree.
All of a sudden, those blue-collar workers realize, ""Son of a gun."" And think of—you guys invest in education in your communities. How many—how many high schools have shop anymore? How many high schools have anything where people know whether they want to work with their hands? It's not happening.
But now, across America, we're going to be rebuilding factories. And by the way, through the heartland of America a lot of this is happening.
By the way, there was a—you know, when we did the—the IRA, the—we're talking about having the internet connected to your home. Well, guess what? In suburban and rural areas, it doesn't happen.
Well, the—the former football coach from Alabama, who was a better coach than he's a Senator, in my view—[laughter]—announced—he said, ""Isn't it wonderful""—and the press will remember the number; I don't—""a billion 400 million dollars or two billion dollars coming to—coming into Alabama, and we're going to have the best Internet system in the world."" Going on and on. He voted against it. So I'm going to be down there for the groundbreaking. [Laughter]
You know, or we have a major, major, major environmental project going up in the gentlelady from Georgia's district. She's—she voted against everything, wants to impeach me. But she said this is greatest thing that happened to her area, in—I think it's Decatur; I'm not sure exactly what town.
But my generic point is that this makes a big difference. And it's giving people an opportunity. Look, you know, in the old days, how many blue-collar white guys didn't vote Democrat? Well, nobody, because we—in my view, we didn't seem to take them seriously anymore. We—you know, it was like, you know, what are we talking about?
Well, it's changing. And it's changing because of the business community. The business community is changing, as well.
And so I guess what I'm saying is that we're in a situation where there's so much more we can do. We have to finish the job, because a lot of people—they support everything we've done, when they poll on it, but they don't know who did it. They don't know how it got done. And there's a reason I haven't been—the press is asking me, legitimately, why am I now just going around the country. Because they're just kicking in now, they—just so they could see what's happening.
For example, the Hudson—going under the Hudson—the tunnel, Amtrak through the—under the Hudson. Well, guess what? That's a billion-dollar project. It's going to generate a lot of work, a lot of income. And guess what? You're going to have trains going through there at 110 miles an hour instead of having to stop. It's fundamentally a gigantic change and—how can you be the strongest nation in the world economically and have a second rate infrastructure, ranked, I think, number 13 in the world? How can that happen? It's not possible.
And so we're making the kind of investments you all have been supportive of. And when we were really, really economically moving, it was working. Again, 13 million new jobs, 800,000 manufacturing jobs.
And you know what that's doing, with all the other investments we're talking about? We also have reduced the budget for—by helping people. Medicare—and I hope none of you are in pharma, but if you are, you're going to be mad at me.
I've been fighting pharma since I was a Senator in my second term. Only outfit in the world we can't negotiate with, up to now.
We—pharma, we were able to negotiate the price of drugs and medicine and—for the—from the—from the—dealing with the—the military costs that we have and what the military pays. Well, we can't do it for anything else.
Well, look, you know, we talk about—we have to deal with inflation still. And I know you guys and women know a great deal about the economy. I get it. But I've been hearing since I got elected, ""Within the next month, there's going to be a recession."" I've been hearing that all along. Pray to God——
[At this point, the President knocked on the podium.]
——it continues to be wrong, because we have such a strong base.
You know, they—they reassessed the growth of the GDP the first quarter: 2 percent—2 percent. I go down the list in all the things that has economically changed. And the—and we're—and I know—and I have to admit it bothers me when we talk about the way to get inflation under control is fire people, have fewer employees. We've got to figure out a way.
Any rate, the point I'm making is that the guy who invented—I mean, how many of you know somebody who needs insulin for—for their—for what they're dealing with in terms of the need to be able to continue to live. And so, you know, how many of you know people—anyway, I won't get into it all.
But the bottom line is, the guy who invented—invented insulin said he didn't patent it because he wanted it available for everybody—available for everybody. Do you know how much it costs to make? Ten bucks—t-e-n—t-e-n dollars. Package it, it's $13.
If I'm going to have you have to deal with that issue and—as a family, and you want to purchase the insulin because you have children and need it or whatever, it—you have to pay about 400 bucks a month.
Now, pharma is not—they're not bad guys. But guess what? Whatever drug you need, if it's made here in the United States by a major pharmaceutical company and sold in New York State, you can buy it cheaper in Toronto, Paris. You can—London, Madrid, all around the world, significantly cheaper.
And that's stopping on my watch. That's stopping. So we got something passed that now Medicare can negotiate drug prices.
And as I was—when I was—this is going sound self-serving—but when we were able to work out the threat of closing down the Government—I mean, of reneging on our debt—we worked it out. They wanted to eliminate—the other team wanted to eliminate everything we passed. Not a joke. Every major initiative, they wanted to eliminate.
And the most interesting conversation I had with the Speaker and others was I said, ""Well, you got to count how we deal with reducing the debt."" I'm the only President that's ever reduced the debt in 2 years $1.7 trillion—$1.7 trillion—and still did all these programs.
You know why? Well, you know, the Fortune 500—or 55 companies who were paid 40—they made $40 billion, didn't pay a penny. We said, ""You've got to pay a minimum tax of 15 percent."" Guess what? It paid for it all. People started paying their way.
And so I said, ""You realize how much we're going save the Government—not just people—the Government and the deficit by the passage of this legislation on insulin: $168 billion deficit reduction."" That's what it is.
So I guess what I'm trying to say here is that when you talk about that, the Inflation Reduction Act, the CHIPS Act, dealing with the bipartisan gun safety—we passed the gun—we've got more to do as a Government. I talk about it all the time. We passed the most extensive gun safety law in 30 years.
I'm the guy who, back when I was a Senator, along with Dianne Feinstein, outlawed assault weapons. We got that done and a number of—of bullets could be in a carbine—that you could have in your—be able to be fired.
Who the hell needs 100 rounds in a—in a weapon? Who ever needs 25 rounds?
When I was selling this as a Senator, we have big—we have a lot of gun ownership in Delaware because of the Eastern Shore, a lot of duck hunting, a lot of—and I'm—I used to walk through in hip boots talking to people who were in there to make the case. And I'm in there and the guy is fishing, and he said: ""You're taking my damn gun, Joe. What are you doing now?"" And I said—I said: ""Let me tell you: How many deer you know are wearing a Kevlar vest?"" [Laughter] ""And if you need more than eight rounds to kill a bear, man, you're in trouble. You're a lousy shot."" [Laughter] And he looked at me, and he said, ""Son of a bitch, you make a good point."" [Laughter]
But we could only get it done for 10 years then, but we've got to get back again. We have to eliminate assault weapons and limit the rounds. Too many people are dying—and not just these celebrated cases you see. Every day in neighborhoods in this city, every day in neighborhoods across America, there's a mass shooting. Every day. And we can change it.
In terms of additional things, we—you know, we—well, I'm going to—I've gone on too long. I apologize.
The idea that we have taken 50 years of Supreme Court decisions based on theories—and this is including the Federalist Society and others—50 years, Roe v. Wade. Since when is it decided there was no right of privacy in the Constitution? This Court overruled 55 years of precedent, saying, ""There is no right."" It's the old far-right position that unless it's mentioned in the Constitution, it doesn't exist.
And guess what that put it in jeopardy? Did you ever think we'd be having debate of whether contraception was available, legal, can be sold over the counter? I mean, the—we're the United States of America. Did you think that would happen? Well, guess what? If you leave it to the States to make a decision, and it's no longer a constitutional right, but the States decide these things, what happens?
And that's why—I'm going to get myself in trouble here, but—and I'll end with this: That's why you've got to help Kathy elect a Democratic Senate here—I mean, excuse me, a Democratic House of Representatives. We can win back five seats here, and I need it badly. I need you to help them. And you can help run some of her house—her senate—her house—her State legislative senate and house seats.
But look, you know, it's—I guess what I want to say is that there is a lot we have to do. And one of the things we can do is deal with the issue of what—letting people know that what's happened and what's changing their circumstances is because of things we've done. And they don't know that part yet. And that's a big thing where you're being able to help me fund this next 16 months, to let people know what and why these things are happening.
I'm talking too much. I'm going to hush up and take your questions. So thank you.

"June 28, 2023","Remarks at a Campaign Reception in Chicago, Illinois","
Whoa. Thank you, thank you, thank you. Please—please have a seat.
Am I interrupting your lunch? [Laughter] By the way, I will not be offended if you keep eating.
Look, folks, I want to thank Governor Pritzker for that introduction. But more than that—I'd probably ruin his reputation now, but he did more in 2020 to help me get elected President of the United States than just about anybody in the country, and that's a fact. You are part—[applause]—and he's doing one hell of a job as your Governor. I appreciate his support.
And you know, I also want to thank the other elected officials that are here: Mayor Brandon Johnson, thanks for the key to the city, man. And congratulations to you and Stacie on your wedding anniversary. What a hell of a way to spend your—you owe her big, man, if this is the wedding anniversary. [Laughter]
Dick Durbin, Tammy Duckworth, Representative Laura Underwood: You've been such important partners in everything we've gotten done. And that's not hyperbole. I really am grateful to have you all here today and give me your support.
And I think our national chairman is here. Jaime, stand up, man. Now, I don't want to ruin Jaime's reputation, but he's from South Carolina and he supported my decision to come to Chicago. [Laughter] Anyway, look—[laughter]—you've been such an important part.
And before I begin, I want to say a word about a good man who was a dear friend and a great American: Jim Crown. You know, I know many of you knew Jim well, and you're heartbroken to learn of his—of a shocking death.
You know, Jim and Paula joined us at the White House just last week at the state dinner for India, and he was—he was thoughtful and warm as ever. He represented America's best. And he was industrious, big hearted. And his commitment to this city was bone deep. It was bone deep. And we're all sending our love to Paula and their—and their kids and grandkids and Jim's parents and siblings. He'll be missed.
It's just shocking. Like I said, I just saw him about 10 days ago.
Now, to all of you here today, I want to say thank you for being here. Thank you for your support. And you've helped us get so much done over the past 2½ years.
[At this point, the President cleared his throat.]
Excuse me.
Now you're making sure that we have the support we need to finish the job. Folks, I'm actually looking forward to this campaign. And you know why? Because we've got a story to tell. We've got a real story to tell. We've got a record to run on. And most importantly, we're not only changing the country, we're transforming the country.
You know, I just left the Old Post Office, where I talked about my economic vision for the country. And we're—what everyone in the Wall Street Journal and the Financial Times have been calling ""Bidenomics."" So I said: ""Okay, Bidenomics. I'll take it."" [Laughter]
But look, just think about what it was like when I came to office—when you got me there. It was—we inherited a mess.
Governor Pritzker remembers all too well. The pandemic was raging. The economy was reeling. Around the world, our allies in Europe and Asia, the Middle East—they were saying they didn't know what we—this new President meant by this idea of ""America first.""
I've got to tell you—and, Jeffrey, you know this—I've got to tell you that I was stunned at how—I've been doing foreign policy my whole life. I was chairman of Foreign Relations Committee. I was—when I was with Barack, I'd handle a lot of the foreign policy, travel the world, and know most heads of state. And I was stunned. I was stunned at the damage that's been done to our reputation internationally. And that's not hyperbole. I give my word to that.
For the first time since World War II, our friends began to wonder whether we could be relied on.
You know, one of the things I said when Putin invaded—and I predicted he was going to invade Ukraine with 185,000 troops; who ever thought that would happen in the postwar era in Europe? I predicted that he was counting on NATO breaking, not holding—not being held together—but we united NATO. We're once again viewed as a world leader.
We created 13 million new jobs—more jobs in 2 years than any President has ever created in a 4-year term. Unemployment rate is down to a 50-year low. Went down to 3.7 percent.
You know, we've seen record lows in Black and Hispanic unemployment as well. Inflation is less than half it was—less than half it was a year ago. Still too high, but it's way down.
And, folks, this didn't happen. We made it happen.
I came to office with a theory and a plan—and one that I've been fighting for my whole career, but I had a chance to actually implement it as President.
The theory was, it was time to end the trickle-down economics, traditional economics; 40 years of handing out excessive tax cuts, the big corporations had been a bust. We had gone—well, all—when it was all done, we hollowed out the middle class in America. We blew up the deficit significantly. We shipped jobs overseas because of cheaper labor. We stripped the dignity and pride and hope of one community after another all across America, particularly from Western Pennsylvania and going through the Middle East—I mean, through the middle of the country and down south.
So we're changing that. We're replacing their trickle-down theory with what the economists are calling Bidenomics. It's working. Bidenomics is about building an economy from the middle out and the bottom up. When that occurs, the middle class does well, the poor have a chance, and the wealthy still do very, very well—do very well.
I'm a capitalist. If you can go out and make a million or a billion dollars, it's good by me, as long as you just pay your fair share in taxes—not exorbitant, not like the old days, but the top tax rate in the 30 percent range.
Look, we started with the American Rescue Plan, a plan to vaccinate the Nation and get our economy going. And that's what it did. Not a single Republican in Congress voted for that plan. Not one single, solitary Republican. But we got it done.
Next, we passed the bipartisan infrastructure law, because you can't have the strongest economy in the world with a second rate infrastructure. Can you believe we used to have the best infrastructure in the world, but now we're ranked 13th in the world in infrastructure?
Under my predecessor, Infrastructure Week became a punchline. Remember it was going to be—no, I'm not joking. It became a punchline. On my watch, making infrastructure was a decade headline. We're going to do it. We're going to get it done.
Now we're investing in America, and it's just coming—everybody says: Why am I only talking about this now? We got all these big pieces of legislation passed, and we were told we couldn't get it passed, because—it took time, without any Republican help in most cases. And now it's there, and we've got to let people know what we've done and how we've done it and why we did it.
You know, our roads, our bridges, our ports, our airports, clean water, high-speed internet, and so much more. Already, we started 35,000 projects all across America.
Earlier this year, Kamala was here in Chicago, at the 95th Street Bridge, to talk about improvements we're making there, and three other bridges nearby. They haven't had major repairs in decades. It's causing traffic detours. I don't have to tell you Chicagoans this. Supply chain delays, from Lake Michigan to the Gulf of Mexico. And that's a fact. That law is going to change all that.
If you wonder where we're investing in your region, just go to invest.gov—invest.gov. You'll see a map; it will show exactly what we're doing in every single project.
For example—and for everybody—I said I'd be President for everybody, not just those who voted for me, not just in blue districts. Everybody.
And here's what's happened. You know, we've—we found that all these guys that voted against all this, they think it's great now, man. No—[laughter]—well, I won't get into all that. [Laughter] I just get excited.
Third, we passed the CHIPS and Science Act. America got a wake-up call during the pandemic. We didn't think much about supply chains before. Well, we do now. I know we can never again be as vulnerable as we were. I've determined that will never happen again.
One key component, for example: semiconductors—those little chips—the computer chips, smaller than the end of my little finger. These small little—little computer chips. Without them, your cell phones don't work; your automobiles cannot be made—300 parts—3,000 chips in there; and the most sophisticated weapons systems the United States has can't be functional. We invented those chips. The United States made the first chip. We invented it. We made it much more sophisticated.
But, over time, we went from producing 40 percent of the world's chips down to 10 percent. And you saw what happened when they got cut off because of the pandemic and—in Asia. What happened? We stopped being able to make automobiles because they need 33,000 of these chips to run. It's—I mean, everything began to shut down.
But we're turning this around. Now the private sector has announced they're investing $490 billion in advanced manufacturing, as well as clean energy, in America—$490 billion.
The fourth thing we did: We passed the Inflation Reduction Act. And we get—that gave—we gave Medicare the power to negotiate lower prescription drug prices, like the VA has been able to do. Dick—Dick Durbin and I have been fighting for this for a long time.
Well, you know, I don't—I want to be clear—everybody thinks it's an exaggeration, but hold up here a second—is that a drug company that makes a product, a drug, here in the United States, if it's sold in Chicago, you can buy it cheaper in Florence, Italy; you can buy it cheaper in Israel; you can buy it cheaper in England; you can buy it cheaper in Toronto. Why? Why?
We allow the VA to negotiate prices for drugs for veterans. But guess what? Every time Big Pharma—when Dick and I would try to do this, every time we'd—it stopped us every time. But not this time. [Laughter] Not this time.
We took on Big Pharma and won this time. Now seniors on Medicare are paying—instead of as much as $400 a month for insulin last year, they're paying $35 a month. It costs only $12 to make it and package it. This is life-changing.
In the first round of negotiations of drug prices, we're going to save the taxpayers $160 billion. That means—and by the way, it reduces the deficit by $160 billion, and it gives people breathing room to be able to help with their inflation.
My dad used to say: ""You know, if—inflation is—is a problem, but at the end of the month the question is: When you pay all your bills, do you have anything—do you have any breathing room? Do you have any—anything left?""
We not only cut inflation, we're going to continue to cut inflation. But this gives people more breathing room, these bills.
And this bill includes the biggest investment, not only in America, but anywhere in the world in climate change—$369 billion, without a single Republican vote.
And that's not all we've done. We passed the most significant legislation to reduce gun violence in 30 years, strengthening background checks, ""red flag"" laws. We banned ghost guns. We have a lot more—we have a lot more to do though.
With Dick's leadership, we kept our promise to put the first Black woman on the Supreme Court. And by the way, I think she may be the intellectually brightest person on the Court. [Laughter] She's incredible. Ketanji Brown Jackson, she is incredible.
We appointed more Black women to the Federal circuit courts than all previous Presidents combined. Combined.
And, folks, I'm not going into much detail, but we've also reestablished our leadership in the world. We've united and strengthened NATO in defense of Ukraine.
You know, as I said, the one thing—the one thing that Putin was counting on was he would split NATO; we wouldn't stay together—we wouldn't be together. Seriously, not a joke. Think about it.
Well, we strengthened the alliance in the Indo-Pacific with a thing called a Quad. I brought together Japan, Australia, India, and the United States. The Indian Ocean is a different place now.
Japan's military budget, they haven't increased that budget since the war, but they've significantly increased the budget to help us in that region of the world to work with us. They made an agreement with South Korea to end their significant disagreement that lasted since World War II. And guess what? They're providing support for Ukraine. They're engaged. They said they understand. No, but think about it.
I spent a lot of time with the Prime Minister. He said: ""I understand. When you have 185,000 troops invade another country, why won't Taiwan be next? Why won't something else happen out here?""
So we united 40 nations of the world that are engaged. In short, restored America standing on the world stage.
We're doing all this while still cutting the deficit. You know, all the talk about big spenders and what we—guess what? A budget agreement I just negotiated with the Republicans, we cut another—nearly a trillion dollars without giving up any of the main requirements that I was for.
On top of that, I cut in just my budget, in 2 years, $1.7 trillion off the Federal debt. No President has ever done that. We did all this, and we cut $1.7 trillion from the Federal debt in two years.
And, folks, look, you remember—you know, when I talk about corporate taxes—I'm a capitalist. You can go out and make millions and billions of dollars. Have at it. It helps. But guess what? You've got to pay a little bit.
Remember when the Fortune 500, the top four—55 companies made $400 billion and didn't pay—$40 billion and didn't pay a penny in taxes? Well, guess what? They had to pay 15 percent, and that paid for all of this we needed. [Laughter] No, I'm not joking. Think about it. Think about it.
That's just some of what we've been able to accomplish with your help in the first 2½ years. Imagine what we can do now. We're here today—I'm here today to ask you to help me finish the job.
For example, we'll cut the deficit more once we make the Tax Code fair, closing loopholes. For example, I come from the corporate State of America. More corporations are—many of you have corporations that are invested—are incorporated in Delaware than every other State in the Union. And I represented that State for 36 years as a progressive Democrat.
But closing loopholes, for example, on crypto traders, hedge fund managers. There's a lot of loopholes in the Tax Code that don't make any sense.
Get—look, there used to be 750 billionaires in America 4 years ago. Now there are 1,000. You know what the average—the average tax rate they pay? Eight percent. Come on. That's less than a schoolteachers, a cop, a firefighter. Just begin to pay a little bit. It's time for the wealthy to start paying their fair share in the country.
I made a promise, and I'll keep it, and I've kept it so far: No one in America making less than $400,000 will see one single, solitary penny in their Federal taxes raised. $400,000. And I've kept that promise, and I will keep it.
But there's so much to do—so much to do on the social agenda as well. That's all they want to talk about is—you know, we—I made a speech when I ran the first time at—at the Independence Hall. And I said our democracy was at stake. And the press said, ""What the hell is he talking about democracy for?""
Well, it turned out 66 percent of the American people agreed with me. Democracy is at stake, and part of it is still at stake.
Let's protect a woman's right to choose and codify Roe v. Wade. No, I really mean it.
Folks, I love the arrogance of the Supreme Court decision. After they said there's no right to privacy in the Constitution, I said a lot else is at stake: contraception, gay marriage, et cetera, because they're based on the right to privacy. And the famous judge, who I will not mention his name, said there are no longer—since there's no longer the idea of privacy in the Constitution, they're not protected. They're going to come after it.
Well, guess what? We're in a situation where they said—I—one of the best lines in the Dobbs decision to me was—they said: This is a state matter. It's not a Federal matter. And now—and I'm paraphrasing—and now let's see what women can actually do.
They ain't seen nothing yet. No, I'm serious—State by State.
But look—and let's keep fighting the existential threat that—the only existential threat to humanity is climate change. I mean, for real. If we go above 1.5 degrees Celsius by the year 2050, we're in trouble. There's no turning it around.
Let's protect our children from gun violence and finally, once again, banning assault weapons and high-magazines. We did it once. And when we did, mass murders came down significantly—significantly. Who the hell needs a magazine that can hold 100 rounds? I mean, seriously, like what happened—anyway.
Let's keep lowering prescription drug costs, not just for those Medicare, but for all Americans.
Let's continue to restore the soul—I ran for three reasons, I said, when I ran—when I announced. Even my staff: ""What are you talking about?""
The first one was, I said we had to restore the soul of this Nation: a sense of decency, a sense of honor, a sense of who we are as American people.
Secondly, I said we had to rebuild the economy through the middle class, from the bottom up and the middle out. We had to do that to make things work.
And I said, thirdly, we had to unite America. And I was told—and understandably, the press said, ""Biden is from another generation."" I'm going to say something that maybe Dick or other Members of the Senate can confirm: I was known as the guy that got a lot of things done in the Senate—a lot of things done. I had relationships across the aisle, and it worked. And we had friendships. But they said: ""That was another day. You can't do it anymore.""
We got enough people to step up and come across—enough Republicans—to pass most of this stuff.
Let me close with this. Here's the bottom line; it's very simple: We need you. That's not hyperbole. We need you. Our democracy needs you, because this is about our freedoms.
MAGA Republicans are trying to take us backwards. But together, we're not going to let them.
I truly believe this country—and I know I don't look it, but I've been around a long time. [Laughter] I truly believe that this country is about to take off. The investments we've made in the past 2½ years have the power to transform this country for the next 50 years. We're doing something right now that no one thought possible.
But the Republicans—Republicans don't like any of it.
[A toddler screeched in the audience.]
I don't blame you, kiddo. [Laughter] He agrees.
Most of them have opposed everything I've done. Most of them want to get rid of it all, but they don't hesitate to take credit for it.
I tell you what, there's that Senator—he's a hell of a football coach in Alabama—who is now the Senator from Alabama—Tuberville—who strongly opposed the legislation that now he's hailing its passage. He voted against the legislation. He says, ""Great to see Alabama receive critical funds to boost ongoing broadband efforts."" End of quote. I told him I'll see him at the groundbreaking. [Laughter]
We've got a fight on our hands. Let me ask you: Are you with me in this fight?
It's been a long time, but I can honestly say I've never been more optimistic. I know a lot of people—[inaudible], but they don't—I believe it, because I know the people of this country.
We've got to just remember who we are. We're the United States of America, and there's nothing—and I mean this from the bottom of my heart. Think about it: No—we've never come out of a problem without being stronger than when we went in.
We have never, never, never failed to accomplish what we set our minds to. There's nothing beyond our capacity if we do it together.
So God bless you all, and may God protect our troops.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

"June 28, 2023","Remarks on the National Economy in Chicago, Illinois","
Hello, hello, hello. Thank you all very much.
And, Bob, thank you for that introduction. Bob has been helping me for a long time. I guess he doesn't know any better.
And speaking of help from a long time, a brandnew guy in town, a guy who—I told him that being mayor, I think, is the toughest job in America. They know where you live, and every time you walk in the grocery store, you get questions. But congratulations, Mr. Mayor. And I think that you've been doing a good job. [Applause] Mayor Brandon Johnson.
Look, you know, there's a guy that helped me more than—I can say this without equivocation—helped me more than anybody in America get elected last time. A single person: your Governor. He stepped up. He raised money. He raised support. Governor, you're the best. Thank you for being such a good friend. No, I really mean it.
And I like hanging around with heroines like Tammy Duckworth. Tammy, God love you. You're the best too, I tell you.
But you know what? My good friend Dick Durbin—and he is a good friend; we've worked together a long, long time in the United States Senate—he's the single most effective Senator in getting things done. And that's not a joke. It's not just Judiciary Committee.
He's made sure that we got more judges appointed—we've appointed more African American women to the—to the Federal bench than any other—every other President combined. And he got the first and brightest Justice Ketanji Brown. He got—I said I was going to put a Black woman on the Court, and he put her on the Court for me. He put her on the Court for me.
Dick, you really are the best, man. And by the way, when I have questions about—just about any—anything at all beyond the Judiciary Committee, I still call him anyway for his advice. So thank you.
And Representative Danny Davis. Danny, you've been a good friend for a long time. He's always there.
And to all the elected officials—Member of Congress, elected officials here today: Thank you. Thank you for the welcome and welcoming me to Chicago.
You know, in the first quarter of the 20th century, the poet Carl Sandburg described Chicago as a ""city of big shoulders."" A ""city of big shoulders."" He was describing the ""big shoulders"" of the working class American town where—who were building this city, at the same time building the middle class.
I'm here in Chicago today, for the first quarter of the 21st century, to talk about the economic vision for this country: the economy that grows the economy from the middle out and the bottom up instead of just the top down. When that happens, everybody does well. The wealthy still do——everybody does well. The poor have a ladder up, and the wealthy still do well. We all do well.
This vision is a fundamental break from the economic theory that has failed America's middle class for decades now. It's called trickle-down economics—fundamental economics, trickle-down. The idea was—it's the belief that we should cut taxes for the wealthy and big corporations—and I know something about big corporations; there's more corporations in Delaware incorporated than every other State in the Union combined. I want them to do well, but I'm tired of waiting for the trickle-down. It doesn't come very quickly. Not much trickled down on my dad's kitchen table growing up.
And it's a belief that we should shrink public investment in infrastructure and public education—shrink it; that we should let good jobs get shipped overseas. And we actually have a tax policy that encourages them to go overseas to save money. We should let big corporations amass more power while making it harder to join a union.
I meant what I said when I said I'm going to be the pro—the most pro-union President in American history. And I make no apologies for it.
My predecessor—if my mom were here, ""and God bless his soul""—my predecessor enacted the latest iteration of a failed—the failed theory. Tax cuts for the wealthy. It wasn't paid for, and the estimated cost of his tax cut was $2 trillion. Two trillion dollars.
Now Republicans are at it again, pushing for tax cuts for large corporations and the wealthy and adding trillions of dollars to the deficit. Trillions.
Folks, let me say this as clearly as I can: The trickle-down approach failed the middle class. It failed America. It blew up the deficit. It increased inequity. And it weakened the—our infrastructure. It stripped the dignity, pride, and hope out of communities one after another, particularly through the Midwest, Western Pennsylvania, and heading west.
People working as hard as ever couldn't get ahead because it's harder to buy a home, pay for a college education, start a business, retire with dignity. The first time in a generation, the path of the middle class seemed out of reach. And I don't think it's hyperbole; I think it's a fact, no matter whether you're a Democrat, Republican, or an Independent.
I knew we couldn't go back to the same failed policies when I ran, so I came into office determined to change the economic direction of this country, to move from trickle-down economics to what everyone in the Wall Street Journal and Financial Times began to call ""Bidenomics."" I didn't come up with the name. [Laughter] I really didn't. I now claim it, but they're the ones that used it first.
I got asked by a press person this morning, getting on the helicopter in Washington, why—""When I asked you about Bidenomics a long time ago, you said you didn't know what it was."" I said: ""I didn't name it Bidenomics. I didn't realize the economists in the Wall Street Journal did."" But I think it's a plan that I'll—I'm happy to call it ""Bidenomics."" [Laughter]
And guess what? Bidenomics is working. When I took office, the pandemic was raging and our economy was reeling, supply chains were broken, millions of people unemployed, hundreds of thousands of small businesses on the verge of closing after so many had already closed—literally, hundreds of thousands on the verge of closing.
Today, the U.S. has had the highest economic growth rate, leading the world economies since the pandemic. The highest in the world. As Dick said, with his help, we created 13.4 million new jobs, more jobs in 2 years than any President has ever—[applause]—made in 4—in 2.
And, folks, it's no accident. That's Bidenomics in action. Bidenomics is about building an economy from the middle out and the bottom up, not the top down. And there are three fundamental changes that we decided to make with the help of Congress and have been able to do it: first, making smart investments in America; second, educating and empowering American workers to grow the middle class; and third, promoting competition to lower costs to help small businesses.
Here's what I mean by all this. Under trickle-down economics, it didn't matter whether you made things, as long as you helped the company's bottom line, even if that meant seeing jobs and industries go overseas for cheaper labor. Supply chains and key products moved overseas, like China and much of Asia. The entire towns and communities, from where I lived all the way out there and through the Midwest, were shut down, hollowed out. I mean literally hollowed out.
All over the country, parents have to say to their—and many of you and all elected officials heard people tell you this—had to say to their children: ""Honey, I lost my job. We can't live here anymore. We've got to move.""
Trickle-down also meant slashing public investment on things that helped drive long-term growth and helped America lead the world in innovation. We used to invest 2 percent of our gross domestic product in research and development. By the time I came to office, that was down to .7 percent.
We used to be number one in the world in research and development. That's what we were known for. Now we rank number nine in the world. China, decades ago, was number eight in the world. Now it's number two in the world. And other nations are closing in fast.
We used to have the best infrastructure in the world—roads, bridges, et cetera—but then we fell to—rated 13th best interstate—investment in infrastructure. Two to thirteen. How can you have the best economy in the world without the best infrastructure in the world? How do you get product from one place to another?
I was out in Pittsburgh recently, the ""City of Bridges""—bridges collapsing all over the Nation. You've seen on television railroad bridges collapsing.
Bidenomics—we're turning this around. We're supporting targeted investments. We're strengthening America's economic security, our national security, our energy security, and our climate security.
I designed and we signed a bipartisan infrastructure law. It's already announced—and you—I heard some of the speakers before touting some of it. It's already announced 35,000 projects across the country.
Think of it this way: Nearly a century ago, Franklin Roosevelt's Rural Electrification Act—Rural Electrification—brought electricity to millions of Americans in rural America. Seventy years ago, Dwight Eisenhower launched the Interstate Highway System, the largest infrastructure project to date in history. That's what the bipartisan infrastructure law does. It will be for our kids and grandkids, only bigger.
Just last week, we announced our plan to bring affordable high-speed internet to end a decade of—that—of unaffordable and inaccessible internet to every home in America, every small business in America. And to no one's surprise—[applause]. And to no one's surprise, it's bringing along converts. People strenuously opposed, voting against it when we had this going on. They were—this was going to ""bankrupt America.""
Well, there's a guy named Tuberville from—a Senator from Alabama, who announced that he strongly opposed the legislation. Now he's hailing its passage. Here's what he said: Quote, ""It's great to see Alabama receive critical funds to boost ongoing broadband efforts."" [Laughter]
[At this point, the President made the sign of the cross.]
[Laughter] We're replacing every single lead pipe in this country and putting our children's health back directly—[applause]—400,000 schools, 10 million homes. We're fixing crumbling bridges, upgrading our power grid, renovating our airports and ports. And, Dick, you're—or one of you talked about that, how important that is for the Great Lakes as well.
Anyway, last week we reopened I-95, back where I live. And you go up the East Coast—it's one of the most important lengths in the entire East Coast. Well, guess what? Less than—we—a guy driving a truck hit a—anyway, he knocked down a whole bridge, and the whole—blocked four lanes of the highway.
I went up there, and I said, ""We're going to get this—the number-one project, to get done."" Within 1 week of my being there, 2 weeks of it happening, tanker trucks that crashed and caused this overpass that has 150,000 vehicles travel on it every day and 14,000 trucks.
It's critical to our economy. We did it with union workers. We closed all the loopholes. We used all American products, all American materials. We used—Federal infrastructure project, made in America. Made in America. Not a slogan; it's actually happening.
You know, when Roosevelt passed the legislation in the thirties about unions being able to be engaged, everybody thinks he just legalized unions. It said we should encourage unions. There was a little provision there that very few Presidents paid attention to. It said, ""Buy American."" That meant that if a President was given money by the Congress to build, say, a new deck in an aircraft carrier, whatever it was, he or she was supposed to use a hundred-percent American labor and a hundred percent American products. It hardly happened. They'd get exceptions down to 30 percent, et cetera.
I changed all that. We're now investing in key industries of the future, making targeted investments to promote domestic production of semiconductors, batteries, electric cars, clean energy.
Under the trickle-down economic theory was that public investment would discourage private investment. Give me a break. [Laughter] We went to see a whole lot of major corporations and said, ""Are you more or less likely to invest if the Government invests?"" Overwhelmingly—they had it backwards—they said, ""No, we're more likely to invest if the Government invests.""
Public investment declined here at home. Industries that we invented started to move overseas, like semiconductors. I want to remind you: America invented these chips, small computer chips the size of the tip of your finger that affect nearly everything in your life, from whether your cell phone functions, your automobiles can be built, refrigerators work. It goes on and on—and to sophisticated weapons systems.
It's all in that little—without that computer chip, we've got a real problem. But over time, we went from producing 40 percent of those world's chips down to 10 percent. Not anymore.
Biden economics means the industries of the future are going to grow right here at home. At home. I mean it. Not a joke. Under Bidenomics, we've already had over $490 billion in private investment commitments—$490 billion—from U.S. companies and companies around the world coming to the United States of America.
Working with our global partners, America's investments in clean energy technology are going to reduce carbon emissions, continue to lower the cost of wind—you talked about the wind farms you're talking about. You know, it's already cheaper. Wind and solar are already significantly cheaper than coal and oil. You're not going to see anybody building a new coal-fired plant in America, not just because I'd like to pass a law to say that. It's too expensive. It doesn't work anymore. Solar power is not just here, but around the world.
And we used to be the center of building these solar panels. We are coming back and doing it again. America is going to lead again.
Look, it's a win for the United States and a win for the world that builds on my decision to rejoin the Paris climate agreement on the first day I came to office. The first day.
And by the way, my predecessor talked a lot about increasing manufacturing. Remember ""Infrastructure Week""? [Laughter] Infrastructure Week became Infrastructure Week and week and week and week and week. It never happened. [Laughter] We got Infrastructure Decade done right off the bat.
But in reality, construction of manufacturing facilities here on U.S. soil grew only 2 percent on my predecessor's watch in 4 years. Two percent. On my watch, it's grown nearly 100 percent in 2 years—100 percent—[applause]—with the help of all the Members of Congress who are here. And I'm not being solicitous.
Look—Weirton, West Virginia: It used to—where a steel mill closed in the beginning of this century—in 2001 or -2, in that range. It employed thousands—it had thousands of good-paying jobs that were lost.
But today, with the help from the inflection reduction act—Inflation Reduction Act, a new plant is being built, building iron-air batteries, which are going to help store energy. And these batteries are going to help store energy. And it's being built on the same exact site, bringing back 750 good-paying jobs, bringing back a sense of pride and hope for the future, for all the people or Weirton and surrounding areas.
I believe every American willing to work hard should be able to say where they grew up and stay where they grew up. That's Bidenomics. You know, my dad used to have an expression. He'd say, ""Joey""—and I give you my word. He'd say—my dad was a well-read guy, never got to go to college, and a hard-working gentleman.
We had dinner at—where we incidentally had conversation and incidentally ate. My dad used to say, ""Remember, a job is about a lot more than a paycheck."" And I mean this; I give you my word. He would say: ""A job is about a lot more than a paycheck, Joey. It's about your dignity. It's about pride. It's about being able to look your kid in the eye and say, 'Honey, it's going to be okay.'""
Think about it. I mean literal sense, think about that. It's about your dignity, how you're treated, and being able to make a living; you can tell your kids it's going to be okay.
The second big part of Bidenomics is empowering American workers.
When I took office, unemployment was over 6 percent. With the American Rescue Plan, we've provided relief and support directly to working class families. Our economy came roaring back. Unemployment dipped below 4 percent by the end of my first year in office. Now it's been below 4 percent for the longest stretch in 50 years in American history.
And I must admit I concentrated on it, but we've seen, with the help of Jesse Jackson's legacy and a lot of other people here, we've seen record-low unemployment for African Americans—record-low unemployment for African Americans—and Hispanic workers with disabilities.
The lowest unemployment rate in 70 years for American women, and you make up half the economy and probably two-thirds of the brains. [Applause] No, really, think about it.
To pause for a second: When I was trying to get—name me a time when you thought any Democrat would get the endorsement—every—within a week, every single environmental group out there, the AFL-CIO, the women's groups.
I mean, here's the deal: When I sat with the AFL-CIO, when I sat with the IBEW—starting when I ran last time—I said: ""Here's the deal though: I'm going to be the most pro-American—most pro-union President in history, but you've got to employ more women, you've got to attract more African Americans, and you've got to attract more minorities."" They have; they're going now. It's beginning to change.
In every industry, from—anyway, I'm—I go to these sites where they're training—by the way, the other thing I've told labor guys: You've got to brag a little bit more about what you do. Do you realize to get a license to be an electrician in this town or any other you've got to essentially go to 4 years of college? You have to go through an apprenticeship that takes you 4 years to 5, depending, or you can't get a job. You get paid a little bit, but you can't get your license to be an electrician, a labor electrician, until that happens.
Look, pay for low-wage workers has grown at the fastest pace in over two decades. Full employment means workers, especially low-wage workers, having more bargaining power to demand good pay, to secure good jobs.
And this is the thing that isn't consistent with whether people think that we're moving in the right direction: Job satisfaction, based on every poll, is at a 36-year high. More people are satisfied with their jobs than any time in 36 years.
And the shame of working-age Americans in the workforce—the share of them—the share of them is the highest it's been in 20 years. Remember what they were saying? ""Biden's policy isn't working. He's just paying people not to work, people on the sidelines."" Well, guess what? Every single day in 4 years before I took office—you may remember, I took a lot of criticism in my Presidency. Republicans charged me with encouraging people to stay home and not work. Well, they were wrong.
The evidence is clear: Americans are back to work who have been on the sidelines, and they want to come back. And we're going to continue this progress by making sure every American has the training and education to participate in this new economy.
We've increased Pell grants and made landmark investments in historic Black universities. We've invested more in registered apprenticeships and center—and career technology education programs than any previous administration in American history.
Because of this new economy, we don't need everyone to have a 4-year degree. It's great if you can get one; we're trying to make it easier for you to get one. But you don't need it to get a good-paying job anymore.
Think of this: How many of you remember going back to high school, and they had shop class, and they had classes where people can learn if they were interested in working with their hands? They don't have them very much anymore, anywhere around the country.
Well, my wife teaches at a community college, full time, still. [Laughter] She has an expression; she says, ""Any country that outcompetes us, that out""—excuse me—""that outeducates us will outcompete us."" We're not going to let that happen. That's why we're investing significantly in education.
I'm determined to keep fighting for universal pre-K and free community college. We're also fighting to make—[applause]. We're also fighting to make childcare more affordable because we know one benefit is that it opens up significant opportunities for parents to be able to go back and join the workforce.
We're also making it easier to empower workers by making it easier to join a union. As I said, I promised to be the most pro-union President in history. And I tell business leaders all the time: Our union workers are the best in the world.
It takes 4 to 5 years in that apprenticeship. It's like going to college. They'll do the right job on time. Long-term costs for business is less.
You know, addressing the 40-year decline in unionization by supporting project labor agreements, collective bargaining, prevailing wage laws, that's the reason today Americans' support of unions is higher than it's been in 60 years—60 years.
And by the way, I met with the Business Roundtable and others. They said, ""Why am I so pro-union?"" And I said, ""Because it helps you."" It really does. Think about it.
The total cost of a major project goes down when you have the best workers in the world doing it. Not a joke. It's true. It lasts longer. You don't have to worry about whether that socket's going to work.
Look, young people are organizing in new companies and industries. You know, I've indicated labor—to labor leaders they must expand their ranks. As I said: more women, more minorities. That's what they've got to do.
The third part of Biden economics is promoting competition. Because when companies have to compete on a level playing field, they have to work harder to attract customers and recruit and retrain workers. Some of you businesspeople in here know that well.
But under the trickle-down economic theory, three-quarters of U.S. industries grew more consecrated—I mean, excuse me—consecrated [concentrated; White House correction]. I'm thinking I didn't go to Mass. [Laughter] They were moving to diminish competition.
Well, that may have been things—made things easier for big corporations. But for everybody else, it made it harder and more expensive. It got harder for small businesses to compete. It stifled integration [innovation; White House correction]. It reduced wages for workers. And it made our supply chains more vulnerable.
So, folks, that's been the Republican plan so far: good for big business, bad for everybody else. It's not even that good for big business anymore.
When I came to office, it was a very different plan: a limited concentration of power at the expense of consumers. The cops are back on the beat enforcing antitrust laws.
My administration is working to crack down on what we used to call ""noncompete agreements."" We still call them that.
These prevent 30 million Americans—from security guards to retail workers—from walking across the street to a same kind of business and getting a higher pay—getting 5 bucks more a week or 10 bucks more a week.
Noncompete agreements? It's one thing to have noncompete agreements when you're dealing with trade secrets. It's another thing when you're doing the same thing of flipping a hamburger, and you're going to get 5 cents more by walking across the street to a different place.
We also—we've promoted and we're supporting small businesses. You know, Vice President Harris has prioritized providing support and capital for small-business owners, including for rural, minorities, and women entrepreneurs; including through a brandnew program that's already helping deliver billions of dollars in growth capital to small businesses in every State.
We've seen a record 10.5 million applications—10.5 million applications—for folks looking to start a small business just in the last 2 years—10.5. Every one of those applications is an application to hope. Hope.
Competition also means lowering costs for consumers. Bringing down inflation remains one of my top priorities. Today, inflation is less than half—less than half—of what it was a year ago and that inflation caused by Russia and by the war in Ukraine and by what was going on. But we knew we had to do more. There's more than one way to bring down the costs.
Another expression my dad used to use—for real, he'd say: ""Joey""—he said: ""At the end of the month, the question is, after you pay all your bills, do you have just a little left for breathing room? Just a little left for breathing room. All your bills paid; do you have anything left?""
Well, inflation eats into that obviously. But guess what? Bringing down the cost of medication goes a long way to giving you a little more.
That's why, through the Inflation Reduction Act, we finally gave Medicare the power to negotiate lower prescription drug prices like the VA does now. We've been trying to get this done—Dick and I—for decades in the Senate. This time, we finally beat Big Pharma for the first time.
You know, the same drug made by the same American company sold in Chicago is more expensive than that same drug sold in Toronto, Great Britain, England—France, Germany, any city you can name. For real. Now, seniors on Medicare are paying as much as $400—less—four—who were paying $400 a month for insulin last year are now paying $35 a month.
Because guess what? You know how much it costs to make that insulin? Ten—t-e-n—dollars. Package it, maybe 12 total. And the guy who invented the insulin didn't even ask for a patent because he wanted everybody to have access to it.
We're just finishing the first round of negotiating drug prices, and we'll save the taxpayers this year $160 billion. That's like a tax cut. It lowers the cost of prescription drugs, and it lowers the Federal deficit as well.
We're expanding health care coverage for more Americans, building on Barack's Affordable Care Act. You know why we're doing that? I'm proud to strengthen that act, saving average families $800 a year on their health care premiums.
We're also fighting to end junk fees. Most people don't think of it that way. Well, here's what a junk fee is: They can add up to a hundred dollars a month—hundreds of dollars a month for a family. Like that extra fee when you say, ""I want my child to sit next to me when I take him to see Grandpop on the West Coast."" It's not listed now. They're listing it now. [Laughter]
Hotel resort fees. You don't realize—you're not told they're going to be—you know that ad in television: ""Mine is $200. His is $180""? Well, guess what? Or the—the one that bothers me the most is overdraft fees for banks. The banks made $7.7 billion a year on overdraft fees. You overdraft on your checking, you get a penalty.
It's—one of the leading bank presidents—God love him, he's passed away—but he had a yacht. The name of the yacht was ""Overdraft."" [Laughter] Swear to God. Well, guess what? There are going to be no more overdraft fees.
Folks, we're doing this—we're doing all this, reducing the deficit at the same time. Just in my first 2 years in office, my team and I have reduced the deficit by $1.7 trillion, more than any President has, just in 2 years. And the budget agreement I negotiate, without having to give away anything of consequence, reduced the deficit by another trillion dollars.
You know, reversing 40 years of Republican trickle-down economics that helped the few, but hurt the middle class, it's going to take some time. But what we're in—we're in a place where some big pieces—and we're moving in the direction where we can get some more done and people will see it.
What I'm doing—and I knew I'd have to do this: All those major legislations we passed, people go, ""That's great."" But they—it takes time to get it out in the field.
It takes time for them to see it. And I'm not here to declare victory on the economy. I'm here to say we have a plan that's turning things around incredibly quickly.
But we have more work to do. For example, does anyone here think the Federal tax system is fair? Raise your hand. No matter how much money you make. We're going to make it fair by eliminating loopholes for crypto traders, hedge fund managers. Big Oil made $200 billion last year and got a $30,000 tax break—$30 billion tax break.
We're going to get billionaires to pay up a little bit, at least a minimum tax. You know, when we—when we began, there were 750—before the pandemic—750 billionaires in America. Now there are a thousand. You know how much their average tax is—they pay in Federal tax? Eight percent taxes. No billionaire should pay a lower tax rate than a schoolteacher, a firefighter, or a cop. I mean, this is—[applause].
And I'm not talking about the old, old days of 70-percent tax. I'm talking about a fair shot. If they just paid the top—at the top tax rate that exists now, which is lower than 30 percent, we'd raise billions and billions of dollars, lowering the deficit, allowing us to pay for so much more we have to do.
That's the next phase of this fight: making the Tax Code fair for everyone, making the wealthy and the superwealthy and big corporations begin to pay their fair share, without raising taxes at all on the middle class.
I made a commitment when I got elected: No one in America making under $400,000 would ever have to pay a single penny more in Federal taxes as long as I'm President. And I've kept that promise. And $400,000 is a lot of money where I come from.
Let me close with this. I came—when I came to office, I had a fundamental decision to make: Are we going to continue to trickle-down economics as a policy—that's failed time and again, that grew inequality, that saw jobs go overseas, that saw—and you've seen it out here—towns hollowed out.
I ran on the promise I was going to end this and that I'd begin to build an economy from the middle out and the bottom up. We're not going to continue down the trickle-down path as long as I'm President. This is the moment we are finally going to make a break and move away from economy that has existed in a fundamentally different direction.
Here's the simple truth about trickle-down economics: It didn't represent the best of American capitalism, let alone America. It represented a moment where we walked away—and how many in this country—from how—how this country was built, how this city was built.
Bidenomics is about the future. Bidenomics is just another way of saying: Restore the American Dream because it worked before.
It's rooted in what we've always worked best at in this country: investing in America, investing in Americans. Because when we invest in our people, we strengthen the middle class, we see the economy grow. That benefits all Americans. That's the American Dream.
Forty years of trickle-down limited that dream at—for those—except for those at the top. Too many for too long have seemingly suggested that it's only available if you have a 4-year college degree and you can work at a teach—or work at a tech center.
These new factories that are opening—these fabs that are opening for semiconductors, without a college degree, you're going to make $100- to $130,000 a year working in those fabs—[applause]—$100- to $130,000 a year.
Well, I believe that every American willing to work hard should be able to get a job no matter where they are—in the heartland, in small towns, in every part of this country—to raise their kids on a good paycheck and keep their roots where they grew up. That's Bidenomics.
I think the economic philosophy is not going to restore the American Dream that we have now, that philosophy. But this new one will. And it's going to help—and I think it's going to help lessen the division in this country by bringing us back together. It makes it awful hard to demagogue something when it's working, although they do it all the time.
I've long said—and I mean this—I was on the Tibetan Plateau with Xi Jinping. I traveled 17,000 miles with him. I've spoken with him more than any other head of state because it started when I was Vice President and President Hu was the President, and he was the Vice President. We knew he was a—going to be the successor.
It was inappropriate for Barack to spend that time with him, but I spent a lot of time with him. I met alone with him, just he and I and a simultaneous interpreter, 68 times—68 hours—68 times, more than 68 hours. By the way, I turned in all my notes. [Laughter]
But—and this is the God's truth—he asked me—we were on the Tibetan Plateau, and he asked me—he said, ""Can you define America for me?"" I said, ""Yes, in one word""—and I meant it—""possibilities. Possibilities."" We're a land of possibilities. And I told him: It's never been a good bet to bet against America. Never.
And I can honestly—[applause]. I can honestly say I've never been more optimistic about America's future. I swear to God. I've never been more optimistic. We just have to remember who we are. We are the United States of America. There is nothing—nothing—beyond our capacity if we work together.
So God bless you all, and may God protect our troops. Thank you, thank you, thank you.

"June 27, 2023","Remarks at a Campaign Reception in Chevy Chase, Maryland","
Well, first of all, thank you. You know, people indicate that putting on a fundraiser is no big deal. It's a giant deal. You've had Secret Service running through the house. [Laughter] You've had all kinds of people. Yes. Your neighbor is saying, ""What the hell you're blocking the roads out there for?"" [Laughter]
So thank you, thank you, thank you. And I want to thank everyone here. And I know that there's a great concern about the situation in Israel. I'm happy to take some questions on that. But I just want you to know that, you know, I've often said, from the time I came to the United States Senate, I've been—and Stu knows—an incredibly strong supporter of the State of Israel.
I've often said: If there weren't—[inaudible]—we'd have to invent one. My dad was what a lot of those of you involved in the community would call a righteous Christian. Our dinner table was a place—this is the God's truth—where we would—my dad worked late to—he ran an automobile dealership. Didn't own it, but he ran it. And he'd come home for dinner every night. And at our house, dinner was a place where you'd ask questions and incidentally ate.
And my dad would rail against what—why we didn't bomb the railroad tracks, the camps, why we took so long to allow the ships to come in, et cetera. And he talked about a phrase that was used often then and still: that silence is complicity. And I mean this—this is a fact; everybody knows this about my dad, when he was alive and at home.
And my dad talked about the fact that—the idea that—and by the way, Chris Dodd's dad was part of the Commission to investigate what happened in the concentration camps. And he'd talk about why we didn't do a lot at the time.
And you know, one of the interesting things is that he used to talk about how it was impossible for the Israelis to—excuse me—the Germans not to know what was going on. And so he convinced me before he—long before he died: The one thing I've done, I've taken every one of my children to Dachau and every one of my grandchildren, because I wanted them to see—I wanted them to see those beautiful homes along the fence line with the beautiful roofs and lovely homes, and they'd pretend they didn't know. But they knew. And I wanted my kids to understand how—how that happened.
Now, I've taken every one of my—my three children—Beau was alive at the time—as well as my grandchildren. I have eight grandchildren; I have two to go. They're too young. But, by the way, they're even trying to change a little bit of what Dachau looked like at the time. It's much more sanitized than it was.
But the point I'm trying to make is, there's been an unbreakable bond we've had with Israel. Our relationship is defined by a genuine friendship. It's defined by a shared interest and shared democratic values. And America is the only nation, in my view—and some of you heard me say this before—that was founded on an idea. Every other nation has been founded based on geography, ethnicity, religion, and whatever.
We're the only one that—I apologize to the press for hearing me say this so many times—but we're the only nation in the world founded on an idea. Nothing else unites us but that idea. And it's one that we say that we hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men and women are created equal, endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights—life, liberty, et cetera.
We've never fully lived up from it, but we've never walked away from it. We've never walked away from it.
And one of the things that concerns me is—you inadvertently mentioned when you were introducing me—and that is that democracy is at stake. Democracy is at stake not just here but around the world. And I called a meeting of all the leading democracies—which we've done. We have fewer democracies today than we had 15 years ago.
And one of the things that I think is important to keep our focus on is that I've been stunned at the damage done by the last administration to us internationally and globally. I mean, I've been stunned how deep it goes. His ""one America""—his, you know, ""America only"" policy has been disastrous. This is a guy who wanted us to pull out of NATO. This is a guy who thought Putin was an admirable guy. This is a guy who thought we could deal with—it just went on and on and on.
So what I've done—I've spent a great deal of my time, in a bizarre way, trying to put the world back together again—not because I'm so special, but I just happen to be President. So I've met with over 89 heads of state so far, and I've—trying to make sure that they understand we're not that nation. We're not the nation that existed.
I'll tell you a really quick story. When I showed up for the first G-7 meeting back when I was just elected in February in London, the G-7—I sat down with all the other—other major democracies and their major economies. And I said, ""America is back."" And one of the member—one of the heads of state turned to me and said: ""For how long? For how long?""
And then another one said, ""Joe""—he would call me ""Mr. President""; we call each other ""Joe"" now. But he said—I said—he said, ""Mr. President, what would you do if you woke up tomorrow morning and read in the London Times that a thousand people broke into the House of Commons, broke the doors down, killed two bobbies, and—to overturn an election that was occurring in the House of Commons? What would you think?""
And I never thought about it quite before. But that's how the world—the rest of the world wonders. They wonder about are we really back.
And one of the things that you've just seen what's happened in Russia, with Wagner and—the group—and Putin: The fact is that Putin was certain that he was going to be able to break up NATO. And Stu knows this: He was positive this was going to be the effect.
So I've spent over 180 hours directly meeting with the group and/or individually, as recently as on the telephone and Zoom with each of the heads of state in Europe this past couple of days, because they look to the United States to decide what we're going to do, how we're going to proceed.
My generic point is this: We have a lot to do, but we have enormous opportunities in terms of American foreign policy. We put together with—the Japanese have been wonderful. They've been wonderful. They've increased their budget. They're—they are engaged in a European war by saying that ""We can't allow it to happen.""
We find—and you know, I became friends with the Prime Minister of Japan. And he indicated to me he was going to make things better with South Korea. He did it. He told me what he was going to do. And I strongly supported it, the idea. South Korea and Japan have had—not had a relationship.
So there's a lot happening around the world. We've also put together a thing called the Quad in the Indian Ocean and in the South China Sea, affecting the—all that security surrounding what—what the—what Xi Jinping is very worried about: being isolated.
Well, that's not the purpose. He asked me why I'm doing what I'm doing. I've been—spent more time meeting with Xi Jinping than any person in—that holds a government office, mainly because it started when I was Vice President.
We knew he was going to become the President. And what happened was: Barack couldn't be talking to him and dealing with him, but I did. And I traveled with him over 17,000 miles in the United States and in China. I know him well.
The point is, he called me and said: ""Why are you doing the Quad? You're trying to surround us and hurt us."" I said: ""No, we just don't want the international rules of—to change relative to airspace and sea space, and you're trying to do that. We're not going to go along with it.""
My generic point is that we're uniting the rest of the world in a way that it hasn't been united before. We have a long way to go. I don't want to overstate it, but I don't want to understate it either.
And we talk about China being this great power. China has enormous problems—enormous problems. I'm not going to get into it right now. But the idea that they are going to be able to do things that they thought they could do is not accurate.
Domestically, I was—I ran—and I'll be very brief. I ran with a specific objective. I was sick and tired of trickle-down economics, the fundamentals of economics. They didn't—they weren't working for America. They weren't working for America. Not much trickled down to my dad's —my dad's kitchen table in terms of helping him. And so I thought it was really important. And I thought the key to the United States power—[inaudible]—in economic growth and stability was when the middle class was growing.
When the middle class does well, everybody does well. The wealthy do very well. The poor have a way up, and the middle class is just fine. And so I've spent a lot of time—and I'm making the speech tomorrow on what the—what the Wall Street Journal referred to as ""Bidenomics."" Well, it's working. It's working. We've created 17—13.2 million jobs in 2 years—more jobs than any President ever has created in 4 years—ever. We've also reduced the Federal deficit by $1.7 trillion. No one has ever done that. The reason it's working is because we're engaging everyone.
And by the way—and I know I get criticized for being so pro-labor. I make no apologies for it. The reason I'm so pro-labor is because, you know, these are people who are feeling left behind. They're feeling—but they also—and they're—and they're clean now.
And here's the deal. You have a circumstance where, you know, to be—to get a license to be an electrician, you've got to spend 5 years—5 years—5 years as an apprentice getting partial pay. And they don't—people don't realize that.
And I met with the Business Roundtable. Told them—and they said why am I so pro-labor? I said: ""What did you say to me when I was working with the Secretary of Commerce on the—as Vice President? What do you need most?"" We interviewed three hundred—and I think—fifty-eight corporate heads. They said, ""We need a better educated workforce."" I said, ""Why aren't you educating them then?""
I said, ""I come from a State of DuPont. More corporations incorporated in my State than every other State in America combined. And the day—and they were the eighth largest corporation when I got elected. Eighth. And guess what? When they bought a new enterprise, they trained their workers. You guys don't spend any money training your workers. You expect the government to do it. So why in the hell are you against my effort to increase education funding?"" And they all looked at me like, ""Hmm, never quite thought of that.""
But my generic point is, it's changing. The idea that any President could be endorsed within a week by the environmental movement, all of it; by the AFL-CIO, all of them; by the women's organizations, all of them; and by significant elements of corporate America in one week, because we're doing something right.
We're not—I—the only thing we have disagreements on these days is taxes. I think everybody should pay your fair share. When you've got a million—you've got—now we have a thousand billionaires. I'm a capitalist. If you can make a million bucks, make it. It's okay by me. Multimillionaire? Good. It's good for the country. But pay your taxes. Not 8 percent average—8 percent. A cop pays more than that. A firefighter pays more than that. We've got to make sure that people know. That's the one thing that we still—we haven't done very well.
Lastly, I also thought it was really important to deal with—as my dad used to say—my dad was a well-read man who never got to go to college. And my dad—you—our dinner table was a place where you sat down to have conversation and incidentally eat. And I'm not joking. I'm not joking when I say that. And one of the things that he said was—he used to say: ""Joey, a job is about a lot more than a paycheck. It's about your dignity. It's about respect. It's about being able to look your kid in the eye and say, 'Honey, it's going to be okay.'"" And he meant it. He meant it.
Well, one of the things we've been able to do, for example—he'd also say that, ""At the end of the month, do you have any breathing room?""
We talked about inflation. And I'll end with this. We have inflation down for 11 months in a row, notwithstanding some of the dire predictions of the—of recessions next month. Hadn't happened yet. I don't think it will because the basis of the economy is so strong now—so strong. But we'll see. I could be wrong.
But here's the point: My dad used to make the point that it wasn't whether the price of gasoline went up and food went up and all those things—which are bad—and housing. But it was about: Do you have any money left at the end of the month?
And guess what? What's the biggest bill most people over 65 pay? Health care. Health care. Why is it that you have—we have the best drug companies in the world—same drug company making an important product sold here in the United States and around the world—same exact product—you can buy it more cheaply in Toronto and you can buy it more cheaply in Germany, London—in London, you can—Frankfurt, Germany. Why? Why is that? Because right now, it's the only industry we can't bargain with. Only industry we can't bargain with. And you pay billions of dollars a year in Medicare expenses. Billions—tens of billions a year.
Well, guess what? In my negotiations with the Speaker of the House when they shut down the Government—that issue—not ""trying to""—but trying to avoid shutting down the Government. I—he wanted—they wanted to get rid of what I just passed. Well, what we just passed was: Medicare can negotiate the price of what it cost.
For example, any of you—I'm sure all of you know someone who needs—who has type 1 or 2 diabetes and needs insulin. Well, guess what? The average cost of insulin for a month is 400 bucks a month. And you know how much it costs to make? Ten—t-e-n—dollars. Ten. The guy who invented insulin didn't patent it because he thought it should be available to everybody. It cost 12 bucks to package it—a total of 12 bucks.
So guess what? We just had Medicare negotiate it. The price of insulin is now, for on a monthly basis, $35. Thirty-five dollars.
And I can go down the list. We're going to—I also—eight different drugs a—a year can be negotiated as well. If you go to the—for example, the VA, they negotiated all their prices. You want to sell us drugs or insulin? You come—you—we negotiate the price with you.
My generic point is, at the kitchen table, if you were able to deal with a little money at the end of the year—you got a little money at the end of the year. I can go down the list.
For example, when my staff thought I was crazy when I said: ""We ought to deal with junk fees—junk fees."" Well, guess what? You know we have—and most people—it deprives people of their pride. You want to take your grandson or daughter to see your mom on the East—on the West Coast, you're going to be surprised when you find you pay almost double the price to have your child sit next to you. You're not told about that.
Old bank overdrafts, you know how much it is—[inaudible]? Fifty-five billion dollars a year. Okay? They're one of the—and I won't name them, but you could check it out—one of the CEOs had a yacht called ""Overdraft."" My word, it's now sunk. [Laughter]
But my generic point is, it's just about treating people with decency. Just let people know what's going on. And that's what we're doing.
And one of the things that have started and—for example, I used—and remember in the beginning you said: ""Biden you can never get anything done bipartisanly. Not possible."" Well, guess what? We did. We did. We passed the act that—you know, dealing with veterans exposed all those burn pits.
We owe—we have a lot of sacred obligation and only one truly sacred obligation: Equip those folks we send to war and take care of them and their families when they come home. Well, guess what? Not anymore. They're going to have to be paid for those losses because of exposure to those burn pits. Why wouldn't we do that?
We used to be number one in the world in infrastructure. We're now number 18. How in God's name do you run—how do you have the most powerful nation in the world with a second rate infrastructure? I'm not—I think it's actually we're number 10.
And the same thing with—we just—just go down the list. We used to invest more in research and development than any country in the world: 2 percent of our GDP. Know what it is now? Point seven-tenths of 1 percent. How do we lead the world?
Computer chips. We were the guys that went out—we invented the semiconductor. We invented it. Invented—we made it sophisticated. We used to have 40 percent of the market; we now have 10 percent in the market.
If you decided it was better to buy it overseas—""Buy America""—people are criticizing me for the Buy America is a provision passed in the thirties. It's totally consistent with all of our international trade. If a President is given money to put a new deck of an aircraft carrier, he's allowed to say, ""We're going to have American labor and American—American products on it.""
Well, guess what? I've said that. Democrat and Republican Presidents of the past didn't say that. They made exceptions saying you can only have—you need 10 percent or whatever.
Well, guess what? Manufacturing is back. We have created 800,000 jobs—800,000 manufacturing jobs. A major article today in Bloomberg, you ought to—I'll leave a copy behind—about—no, I'm serious—major article and—by a Syracuse paper saying how we're bringing back all of manufacturing—think of all the places—and you—we've been campaigning a lot together, Stu—think of all the places where in a place like in—in the Midwest or in Western Pennsylvania or—where all of a sudden, the factory that's been around employing 2-, 3-, 5-, 700 people for years and years gets shut down. Why does it get shut down? Because labor is cheaper overseas, we export the jobs and import the products. Not anymore. Not anymore.
One—we're going to put $495 billion in private investment, just since I've become President, in infrastructure, as well as new endeavors. Almost $500 billion.
This idea that when our Government is setting—we did a survey: Are you more likely as a corporate entity to invest in a project where the government has an interest or not? Eighty-five percent said more likely.
So my point is, we're creating thousands and thousands and thousands of good-paying jobs. And the middle class is growing. And it's only now becoming clear.
I was asked earlier by a group of editors I met with—not editors—columnists. And they said, ""Why are you talking about it now so much?"" A simple reason: We couldn't start it off—we started it off, we passed all this, but no one knows what it meant. None of it was happening. Now we have 35,000 infrastructure projects underway—bipartisan infrastructure projects.
Guess what? McConnell needed a bridge across the Ohio River. It cost a billion dollars to fix it—$1 billion. But it affects the commerce of the entire Midwest area, so we're building a new bridge. I indicated I was going to be President for everybody, whether they voted for me or not.
You know, the point is that there's a lot—for example, I know I'm a big Amtrak guy. So I—[inaudible]—Amtrak, everybody kind of rolls their eyes. I get it. I've traveled 1,200,000 miles on Amtrak. Commuted every single day for 35 years.
Here's the point: If you think about it, there is a tunnel going through Baltimore underneath the bay there, and there's one in New York as well. Those tunnels are—nothing has been done on one of them since 1906.
I'm probably the only non-Amtrak worker that's walked through that tunnel. There are lightbulbs hanging down. There's flooding going on. There is a lot of problems. You have to slow down to 30 miles an hour to go through there with the train.
We're fixing it. It's cost a lot of money, a billion dollars. But guess what? It's going to save billions of dollars because now you'll be able to go through it 100 miles an hour.
We learned one thing for sure—certain: If in fact you could travel from point A to point B faster on a train than your vehicle, you leave your vehicle home. It has profound impact on dealing with the environment, which I'm—the last thing I'll mention. Oh, no, I won't; I'm going to get a question on the environment, so I'm going to wait on that. I think I'm getting a question about it.
Anyway, my point is, I am really optimistic. I'm optimistic about the notion that I think the American—I'm confident the American people are decent and honorable people. They've just been confused as hell.
And there—and when I made that speech when I was running in 2020 at the—at—up at the—in Philadelphia, and I—I made the speech about democracy was at stake. And with all due respect to the press, they said, ""What the hell is he talking about that for?""—by and large, notable exceptions. But, ""why is he talking about that?""
Well, guess what? Sixty-six percent of the American people agree with me. They're worried about the—literally, I'll end with this—democracy in America. What's happening? Not a joke. What's happening?
We talked about the Supreme Court—great news today. And there is great news. I think Roberts is beginning to have an impact on the close calls.
But think about what's happened, what we've done in terms of individual rights—individual rights, everything from gay—LBGTQ rights all the way through to rights relating to having an abortion. You know, I'm determined to bring back Roe v. Wade. And my objective to do that is to get the States—half the States to decide that, because now the Court said, you know, it's State issue.
And the thing I love, they said, ""And we'll see what women can do."" They're going to find out. [Laughter] They're going to find out. But my point is, in addition to all this, the world is changing so rapidly. It's understandable why people are concerned.
Last point: The pandemic—I think we're going to find—and I wrote about this early on—a profound impact on the psyche of the American people. A profound impact.
Mental health concerns are higher today than they've ever been in history of America. Look what's happening. Third graders are 7 to 18 months behind in their education. Across the board, schools, teachers—look, these guys wanted to cut 100,000 teachers in the negotiation that happened—100,000 teachers. Try being a teacher in a classroom.
Did you ever think you'd live in a country where books are being banned? No, I'm not joking. Think—I mean, think about the things that are happening.
So people are confused. We've got to let them know who we are. Let them know who we are, what we're for, and what we're against. And I think we'll be okay. But with that, I'm going to—as my mother would say, ""Hush up, Joey."" And I understand I've got some questions coming.

"June 27, 2023","Remarks at a Campaign Reception in Chevy Chase, Maryland","
The President. Well, folks, you know, I may step down there and talk so I can see you all. Look, I'll try to be relatively brief here.
Sandy and Stewart, you've been helping me for a long time, and helping me not only with your personal contributions, but you know, people make judgments about elected officials, in large part by the people who support them. I really mean it. It's all of you who have been—almost every one of you have helped me in the past. Every one of you has been really generous.
And, by the way, I want you to meet the next United States Senator from the State of Delaware. Stand up, Congresswoman.
Our families are close. Her sister ran my office that got me reelected. Her father was first-team all-American in basketball. And he was with the ""Fabulous Five."" He is literally picked as one of the best ball players in history. He went to an all HBCU. They won the national championship back in the sixties. And her dad is an incredible guy—incredible guy. But her mother has all the brains. But—all friends.
Look, folks, you know, there's a lot at stake, to state the obvious. And I want to make sure that—you know, you've probably heard me say that I'm more optimistic about America today than I've ever been in my entire career. And that seems like a contradictory thing to say when so much wrong—is going wrong in the country.
I was—I've met with—with Xi Jinping face to face more than any other world leader has. I've spent over 85 hours with him alone, 68 of which are in person. Back when I was Vice—when I was Vice President, it was clear he was going to become the President. Barack could not spend the time with him. And so I was the—I traveled 17,000 miles with him all across the world, including in China.
And we were on the Tibetan Plateau on one of our meetings, and he looked at me, and he said, ""Can you define America for me?"" And I said, ""Yes, I can, in one word."" And he looked at me. I said, ""Possibilities."" No, really.
Think about it. It's one of the reasons why a lot of other countries think we're the ""ugly Americans."" We think we can do anything.
There's never been anything we've set our mind to do as a country we haven't been able to eventually—never, never. And there's so much at stake right now.
You know, when I was deciding whether or not to run again for office—and I had been out of office 4 years. I was a full professor at the University of Pennsylvania. They gave me a couple-million-dollar budget to hire personnel. I had people like Tony Blinken working for me.
[At this point, there was a brief microphone malfunction.]
Is this still working? There you go.
And I wasn't going to run again. My—my son had just died. And what happened was: I was—I was watching the television one night, and I saw the—what happened in Charlottesville, Virginia. And I saw, literally, people coming out of the woods carrying torches—out of the fields—you couldn't make this up—carrying Nazi flags and singing the same venomous antisemitic chants they sang in thirties in Germany—and accompanied by White supremacists and the Ku Klux Klan.
And a young woman was killed, a bystander, and I spoke to her mom. And when the outgoing—the existing—the sitting President said—""What do you think, Mr. President, of what happened?"" He said, ""I think there were very fine people on both sides."" ""Very fine people on both sides.""
And I thought to myself, ""How can that possibly—how could you possibly say that? How could you possibly—be so encouraging to White supremacists and Nazi sympathizers—neo-Nazis?"" And so I decided I was going to run.
But then I realized how ugly it would be. And so I wasn't sure I wanted to put my kids through that, because I knew what would happen.
And so we have a tradition in our family, for real. Any child can ask for a family meeting. And I'm serious; we've had, since I've been alive, nine family meetings total. And they're taken seriously. Any child can ask for a family meeting, because if I asked for one, it's important.
And my kids and my grandkids asked if we could have a family meeting. And my granddaughter, who was then a senior at Columbia Law School, my—another granddaughter, who was a senior at the University of Pennsylvania, one was a junior—a sophomore at Penn, and one was on her way there. And they asked for a meeting.
And my little grandson, who is now 18 years old, was, I guess, 9 years old or thereabouts.
And they said: ""Pop, we know it's going to be ugly. We know."" Being the son or daughter or granddaughter of a Senator, a Vice President, a President, and a—or attorney general or a decorated war veteran like my son was, is—they—they're used to—everybody thinks it's a great thing. But you get a lot of downside for that.
And so they made the case. My—my grandkids: ""Daddy wants you to run. They know it's—and we know it's going to be tough.""
My little grandson, who was, I guess—well, how would he be then? He would have been probably 6 years—7 years old. He took out his cell phone. He said: ""We know, Pop. It's going to be terrible.""
And he showed me a photograph on the internet—a photograph—a photograph of me walking out of the church where my son just had a military service and a—out on the way to the graveyard with my hand on a—hand-draped [flag-draped; White House correction] casket with my—where my son was being escorted.
And I used to always hold my grandson—my son Beau. In church, I used to—when he would walk—under his chin, I'd let—put my arm around him and—and hold him. So I had my little grandson Hunter, his son, standing next to me, and I did the same thing. And the—[inaudible]—said, ""Biden molests another child."" And so he said, ""We know it's going to be ugly, Pop.""
And so I ran. And I ran for three reasons.
One, to restore the soul of this country—not a joke, not a joke—decency, honor, being able to treat people with respect, not doing what we're doing.
Secondly was to rebuild the country from the middle out and the bottom up. Not that—I wasn't big on trickle-down economics, because I think—I'm a capitalist. If you can make a million dollars or billion dollars, have at it. I really mean it. I support that. But everybody—when you only trick—when you think it's going to trickle down, not much trickled down on my dad's kitchen table.
So I've always been of a view that the way to build a country economically and reestablish our dynamism was to rebuild the middle class. And when you rebuild the middle class, the poor does very well and the wealthy still do very well.
And the third reason was—[inaudible]—unite the country. And you'll recall that's when the press justifiably said: ""Joe Biden is out of touch. He used to be able to do that; he had a reputation to be able to pull Democrats and Republic together, but you can't do it anymore. That time has passed.""
But I was convinced it could still happen.
So the end result was, when I got elected, I hired people with me who share—and by the way, my staff, including the campaign staff, didn't buy onto my reasons. I mean, they thought they were right, but they didn't think it was the way to run. The end result was, though, we were able to win.
And when we did, we put together a team on foreign policy and domestic policy, because I'm convinced—I'm convinced that we can, in fact, unite this country in a way that it hadn't been united in a long, long time. And one of the things that I had—had said—[inaudible]—we thought that we would be able to pull people together in various—both in foreign policy and domestic policy.
Before I announced—before I decided to run, I started to write another book. And this book wasn't about my son. This book was about what was changing the world, how technology has changed the world. And I started off on the first chapter talking about the printing press and Gutenberg, how it fundamentally changed relations among countries. And I was going to work it all the way through where—what's happening now with AI and other things, which I don't know nearly as much about.
And so what happened was that I realized that I had to do something to demonstrate why we could be so good. And so one of the things we did in the foreign policy—I was convinced, and still am, that the world is changing so rapidly, we have a chance to do things we could never do before.
Think about this: If anybody told you—and my staff wasn't so sure, either—that we'd be able to bring all of Europe together in the onslaught on Iraq [Ukraine; White House correction] and get NATO to be completely united, I think they would have told you it's not likely. The one thing Putin counted on was being able to split NATO.
My staff has figured out I've spent 180 hours—180 hours in direct contact with my friends in Europe and NATO members in the EU. And above—of that, a lot of it was in person, but some of it was on Zoom.
And we've been able to hold the west together—hold it together. That's the one thing that Putin thought he could do is break it. And he still thinks he can break it. But guess what's happened? By holding the West together on everything from North Africa all the way to dealing with what's going on in Europe, we've changed the dynamic.
And the idea that—for example, I—I said I was going to go to—to Japan to meet with the Prime Minister, because he would be—he would change his views. And I spent a lot of time with him. And he didn't need my convincing as much as he'd already decided—first time Japan has increased their military budget significantly and got engaged in a European war, because he knew that if they didn't do that, it would send a green light about Taiwan and a number of other things. And he's gotten deeply involved.
I said something at a fundraiser earlier last week that was misleading. I didn't mean to be. And that was that—I said I convinced him to deal with South Korea. He told me he was going to work out something with South Korea, because of the World War II leftover—and he did. And then I strongly—he asked me to strongly support it, which I did.
The idea that you have—in the Far East, you have—in the Pacific, you have Japan and South Korea working with United States, dealing with what's going on in Europe as well as the Taiwan Straits.
The idea we were able to put together a thing called the Quad—that is India—excuse me, India, Japan, the United States, and Australia—fundamentally changing security in the Indian Ocean and the South China Sea.
A whole range of things that are happening—a whole range of things that are happening around the world. And this is the first time—you think of this—none of you can—I—even if you're as old as I am, you can't think of a time when the world was moving so rapidly in determining what their alliances were and where they were.
You probably saw my new best friend—[laughter]—the—the Prime Minister of a little country that's now the largest in the world, China—I mean, excuse me, India. India is not looking for a permanent alliance, but they're looking for some hedge against—in the region.
So my point is, the world is changing. And if you take a look at Africa and South America—and Africa is going to have a billion people—one billion people by 2033. And they have very little ability to deal with changing the infrastructure and growing their economies. And so we convinced our G-7 partners that we all should be doing—we're the ones that cause climate change. The west to—we cut all our forest down. We—and so what are we doing to do to help Africa?
They need—and by the way, China came in and said, ""We'll give you money to build your roads as long as you use Chinese workers and as long as you pay us a lot of money to allow us to dock our ships."" Well, guess what? That turned into—instead of Belt and Road, it turns into a noose and debt. And so it's all changing.
We've convinced our colleagues—for example, we're going to build a largest—the west is going to build the largest solar facility in the world in Angola. We're going to move to—and we're going to have—build the first transcontinental railroad across all of Africa. All of us are going to do that. Why? Some countries have the significant food resources. Some people have energy resources. There's no way they could share it even if they want to. None at all.
So my generic point is, the world is changing. In Latin America, the same way. Look what's happening in the Gulf. We're working like hell to deal with trying to generate support for democracy in the region.
And, for example, in Brazil—the Brazil rainforest absorbs more carbon out of the air than every ounce of carbon emitted from the United States on a yearly basis. We've got to preserve it. It costs a lot of money to preserve, but guess what? All those folks want to go in. And they have farmers, and they want to clear cut, they want to plant crops, et cetera.
So I'm trying to work with our allies around the world to provide them money not to do it. Pay them not to do it to give them opportunities to generate industries and all that.
I could go on, but the point is, the world is changing. It's changing. And we have an opportunity to send it in the right direction. We really do. And I think that's why I'm so excited about—I know it's why I'm so excited about the prospects for the next 4 years and beyond, because we can change the dynamic of the world right now. It's within our power to have significant—if we can keep our allies together and grow them.
And so the second thing is on the economy. When I was a kid in the Senate—[laughter]—I was 29 when I got elected. I had to wait 17 days to be sworn in.
But my point is that I—I say—as I said at the outset—and I'm going to make a speech on this in Chicago tomorrow: The Wall Street Journal and—what was the other major publication? The Journal and one other major conservative publication referred to my economic plan as ""Bidenomics.""
And they've been very actually complimentary about it, because I was convinced, as I said, that we had to become the leader in the world in infrastructure. How can you be the leading nation in the world and have a second rate infrastructure? We're ranked number 9, 10, or 11—whatever the hell it was. We used to be number one.
How in God's name could we be the leading country in the world when we have a circumstance where we don't have—we used to invest more in research and development than any nation in the world. And guess what? We used to have 2 percent of our GDP. Guess what? Now it—[inaudible]—seven-tenths of 1 percent of our GDP. So we changed that. We changed that by the legislation we passed.
How can we be in a position where—my dad used to have an expression. He said, ""Joey, inflation is a real problem."" This is back when I was a kid. But it's not—the real question for middle class families and poor families says is: Is there anything left in your paycheck? Do you have any breathing room left in the paycheck?
My dad literally—my word as a Biden—my dad used to say: ""Joey, your job is about a lot more than a paycheck. It's about your dignity. It's about respect. It's about being able to look your kid in the eye and say, 'Honey, it's going to be okay' and mean it."" I swear to God, that was my dad, for real. For real.
And so—and what happened? Well, we decided that we had to do something to give people a shot. And so what we did was, we changed—we—at the end of the day, inflation—we brought it down 11 months in a row. I hope it continues, but think about it. Major, major banks and—and international finance organizations, they said, ""The recession is coming next month."" It's been coming for 11 months.
Well, guess what? I don't think it's going to come because we've never had as dynamic a growth in American history—never—even including Roosevelt's time. We have—we've created 13.6 million new jobs, 800,000 manufacturing jobs—800,000 manufacturing jobs.
If you go on—and so when you talk about what's happening in terms of—as my dad says, ""a little breathing room""—more than one way to provide breathing room to deal with inflation. We're bringing inflation down and, God willing, we'll continue.
But here's the deal. At the end of the month, if you're—what are you worried about: the inflation going up as high as it's been or being able to pay your medical bills?
We pay—we pay the highest prescription drug prices of any nation in the world—of any developed nation. The same company, making the same exact drug sold in Toronto or London or Paris or Bucharest is significantly cheaper. Why?
I was in Northern Virginia not long ago doing a town meeting, and a lovely woman stood up with—almost tears. And she said, ""I have two children with type 2 diabetes."" She said: ""And—and I need insulin. And I have a job, but my insurance won't cover that insulin. And I had to split it sometimes."" Talk about depriving a family of their dignity. Knowing you had to split the insulin and one of your kids may die. I mean, talk about the impact on a family.
And so I decided that—I've been fighting this for a long time—over 20 years—it's about time that we were able to negotiate drug prices with the pharma companies.
For example, you know how much it costs to make that insulin? Ten—t-e-n—dollars. Ten dollars is the actual cost. To package it, another $2. So now they—that insulin costs $35 instead of $400 per insulin shot—a month.
The point I'm making is—and by the way, I even—originally when I wrote it—it passed the Senate—including everyone, not just the people on Medicare. They—my friends on the Republican side knocked out the non-Medicare portion.
But the point is, I keep—and when we were doing that settlement on trying to figure out how to keep us from going bankrupt as a nation for the first time in American history. Well, I said, ""Look""—they said, ""We're not going to do anything having to do with taxes.""
And I said, ""Well, let me tell you something."" And they moved to eliminate this legislation—eliminate all the legislation we passed. And I said, ""You know, it saves the country money."" I said: ""It saves the people who are on—need this insulin about 350 bucks a month per insulin shot. But it also saves the country $168 billion less being paid out.""
They looked to me. They said, ""How can""—that's what it does, by the way, because the—your taxes are paying for that Medicare. And when you reduce the price of this whole project we have—for example, next year, we pick eight more drugs, and they negotiate the prices of those drugs. It's already in the law.
Well, guess what? They're trying to eliminate it again in their new legislation. They wanted to make sure they made fundamental changes in Social Security and Medicare—eliminate a lot of it.
By the way, I never thought my third State of the Union Address would be negotiated on the floor of the United States Congress, but it worked. [Laughter] Remember when I said—[applause]—because I said, ""They want to cut Social Security and Medicare."" And they said: ""Liar! Liar!"" And I said, ""Okay."" I said, ""Everybody who thinks you want to cut it, raise your hand."" Silence. I said, ""Everybody who is opposed cutting—promised not to cut it."" No one raised their hand. I said, ""Folks, you're on camera."" [Laughter]
But all kidding aside, so when you reduce prices—for example, you all know about junk fees. The average American does. Now, you want to take your grandson or daughter to see your mom or dad and—if they're still alive—or your mother or father to California to see them. And you have a child with you. Not until you get the ticket do you find out you paid about double for the ticket to have your child sit next to you.
Or, for example—I don't want to insult anybody who is a banker here; there's a lot of good bankers. But guess what? Overdraft fees—155—$55 billion a year in overdraft fees.
There was one banker—I'm not going to mention his name; he's probably a good guy—he had a yacht called ""Overdraft."" [Laughter] As they say, ""Google it."" You'll see I'm telling you the truth. ""Overdraft."" Well, guess what? It sunk. [Laughter]
But my generic point is, these are the things that matter to ordinary people—to ordinary people. And they're big numbers for ordinary people. When they find out all these extra costs that are hidden costs.
And my staff thought I was crazy. I think it's fair to say my staff didn't think it was such a great idea. Well, guess what? It's off the charts because people don't like being played for suckers. Whether you're wealthy, you're middle class, or you're poor, you don't like being played for a sucker.
My generic point is, those hidden fees are part of what people think is wrong with the country generally. They think they're being taken advantage of across the board, and they're not. They're not. So if you pick the ones that are the most egregious and eliminate them, it makes a big difference, in my view, in terms of public confidence, which leads me to——
You know, I made a speech when I ran last time—and some of you were foolish enough to help me then, too—in New York City, at Independent—I mean in Philadelphia, at Independence Hall, on democracy being at stake. And I got roundly criticized by the press. ""What the hell is he talking about that for? Who cares?"" I mean, no one thinks that—not everybody in the press, but a lot of criticism.
Well, guess what? Over 65 percent of the American people worry about democracy being at stake, for real. Think about it. How about—did you ever think we'd be in a position where not only 55 years of Roe v. Wade would be overruled, but then you have two Justices saying: ""And by the way, let's make it clear there is no right to privacy to who you marry. There's no right of privacy""—and it goes down the whole list of things. Contraception. And when I said they're going to go after that, what's happening now in many States across the Nation? Outlawing contraception.
So I'm—you know, I happen to be a practicing Catholic. I'm not big on abortion. But guess what? Roe v. Wade got it right. Roe v. Wade cut in a place where the vast majority of religions have reached agreement. Historically, the first 3 months or thereabouts, in all major religions, was: That's between a woman and her doctor. The next 3 months is between—I mean, just a woman and her family. Next 3 months is between a woman and her doctor. The last 3 months have to be negotiated, because you can't—unless you are in a position where your physical health is at stake—you can't do it.
And so, in addition to that, we found out that it used to be an accepted principle that rape and incest were exceptions—were exceptions to that rule. Look at the States that have changed the rules. Look at the States that have changed the rules. State legislatures. Did you ever think you'd see a day when you would not only—forget your position on abortion—but were rape and incest were not even considered, number one? Couldn't be. And at the same time, we're in a situation where you were—we're banning books in schools, and not just any—not just the schoolboard; anybody can come in and call for the banning of a book.
I mean, this the United States of America, for God's sake. The United States of America.
And so there's—and one last thing: The rise of anti-Semitism in America is out of whack. Way out of whack. So I've set up a major Commission. I brought in all the—all the groups into White House to focus on dealing with—dealing with anti-Semitism.
But it's not just anti-Semites. Look what's happening in terms of the way women wearing a headscarf—most at-risk people in America. God love you, I'm so proud of you. No, no—we know each other. But I mean it.
But think—think about what's happening in the United States of America. Gun legislation. Gun legislation. I was the guy, along with Barbara—excuse me—the Senator from California who's about to retire, who got the assault weapons ban passed. And you know what? It worked. It drastically reduced the number of mass murders across the country. And there was a mass murder in every poor neighborhood in America every single day. And it fundamentally changed it.
And—but I couldn't get it passed for more than 10 years. And we have to reauthorize it. And the Bush administration came along and—both Bushes are decent people, but they succumbed to their—to the gun lobby.
You know, they're the only major industry in America you cannot sue. It's—[inaudible]—law is the gun industry, gun manufacturing. Well, imagine if that had been the case with tobacco. How many thousand more people would be dead if we couldn't sue the tobacco companies?
And so I think we've got to change two changes. One, we have to once against assault weapon, which I'm going to get done come by hell or high water. And two—two, we have to change the law—[inaudible]. It doesn't mean that everything happens is their fault. But I found out, when I was up in—[inaudible]—up in Connecticut—the fact is that, as I'm told—I can't swear to this; I haven't verified it yet—is that one of the reasons we're—the gun manufacturers are so committed to the AR-15 is because it's the biggest moneymaker they have, and they sell more than any other weapon. The single biggest moneymaker they have.
And you know who they sell it to? They sell it to young people. They talk about: ""This is your manhood. This is what you""—I mean, what's going on?
And the fact we don't have background checks that are universal, that you're—can walk in at 16, 17, 18 years old and buy a pistol in many States? Open carry—that's a real good idea. That's a real good idea.
My wife is a full-time school professor. They want schoolteachers to be able to be armed, as if that's going to—now, my wife might be able to shoot you.
But no—but all kidding aside, think about it. Think about what the hell we're doing. And think about the number of—I won't go through the detail with—[inaudible]—the number of mass murders that have occurred. The number. It's—I mean, it's at a historic high. We can stop it.
So there's two things we need to do. We have to outlaw assault weapons, and we have to outlaw magazines that can hold more than nine bullets. That's even too much. But I don't think I've been—by the way, in Delaware, we have a high rate of gun ownership because there's a lot of duck hunters, for real. That's why so many—mostly shotguns.
But at any rate, I was going through trying to sell the assault weapons ban when I was—the first time around as a Senator. So I'm walking through the Delaware—the Delaware-Maryland area has an awful lot of swamp area, all through the—and I always kid Steny Hoyer and say, ""The best part of Maryland is in Delaware."" [Laughter]
But all kidding aside—but all kidding aside, I'm walking through and I—in Delaware. As the Congresswoman can tell you, it's hand to hand, they expect you to—for example, Pete du Pont was a very competent Governor and wanted to run against me for the Senate. They did a survey. ""Have you ever met Pete du Pont?"" Seventy-one percent of the people said yes—or sixty-one. Seventy-four said they'd met me, and they said, ""Have you ever met them more than once?"" Fifty-eight percent said me. And 29 or 30 percent. I mean, no other State in America is—it's all hand-to-hand combat in Delaware. [Laughter]
And so, anyway, I was walking through, and this guy said, ""You're going to take my damn gun from me, Biden?"" He was fishing. And I said, ""What""—I said, ""What do you mean?"" He said, ""You going to take my gun away."" And I said, ""No, no, I'm just going to take your AR-15 away if you have one."" He said, ""Why are you doing that?"" I said, ""How many deer wear Kevlar vests out there?"" [Laughter] And he looked at me. No, I swear to God, true story.
Not only, I said, ""Well, what do you need something can shoot up to 200 rounds? Remember what happened in Colorado? Remember what happened?"" And he said, ""I don't."" And I said, ""Well, if you do, you're a hell of a lousy shot."" And he said, ""Damn""—I won't say exactly what he said, but ""Damn, boy, you made a point.""
Because they're trying to make it seem like we're trying to take everybody's gun away. Not true. But we have to have some rational basis for gun ownership.
The last thing I think I'd like to mention to you is education. You know, my wife has an expression. And my wife never—she never talked to a group of more than the size of her school ever. And now she's out talking to 8-, 10,000 people sometimes, because she's so committed.
And my point is this: She has an expression. She said, ""Any country that outeducates us will outcompete us."" Any country that outeducates us will outcompete us.""
And what's really even hurt education more is the pandemic. It's had a profound impact on the mental health of our children but also the loss of 6 months—the loss of 3 months in school is equivalent to losing a year and a half of education. All this data shows this is real.
And so I think we have to invest more in education. Rather than just having daycare centers, I think we should have pre-K at 3 years old.
What happens is—all the studies have shown in the last 10 years, from Stanford to Harvard to Penn—all the major universities—University of Virginia, et cetera—have done studies that show that no matter what home you come from, what background, if you start off learning reading, writing, arithmetic, and some version of that when you're 3 years old, you have a 57-percent better chance of going through all 12 years and on to maybe an apprenticeship or community college. That's significant. That is significant.
And by the way, I met with the Business Roundtable. And when I was—right when I was Vice President, the Secretary of Commerce was the sister of the Governor of California, a really brilliant woman. And we interviewed, by phone mostly, over—I think it was—don't hold me to the exact—540 or 549 or -50 CEOs of the Fortune 500 companies and asked what's their—what's their major concern they have. You know what they say, the majority? A better educated workforce. And I said, ""Well, you're not helping much.""
And I pointed out that in the State of Delaware, which used to, when I started running, be called the ""State of DuPont""—a very important family in the State. But the company was the eighth largest company—corporation in the world at the time; it's now number 81 or something like that.
But I said the DuPont company, when they buy a new enterprise—which they were doing not infrequently—they would educate that enterprise. They would educate those people. And I said—and I'd ask on the phone. I'd—[inaudible]—I said: ""You don't have to answer me, but do you educate your new employees? Do you educate them?"" Virtually nobody does anymore.
And I said, ""So why are you opposing my effort to have a better educated public?"" And it was silence on the phone most the time. And they changed their mind, the vast majority, because of the data that's coming in and what we can do.
And so I guess what I'm saying is, I think part of what we have to do is try to get away from the basic labels—that ""Biden is a liberal"" or ""Biden is a right-winger,"" or ""Biden is whatever he is""—and talk about the facts—not just Biden, but other—other of my colleagues, in both the House and the Senate and in other positions.
And I think we can get there. I really think we can get there because I think—and I spoke with a couple of folks today, a couple of columnists, and I've spoken to some of the press. The idea that—the idea that they think they're going to increase their standing by going right back at what I was able to brush off—having them move away from, in terms of eliminating all the programs I've mentioned plus others, including Social Security and Medicare they're changing again, after promising they wouldn't, and agreeing in the agreement that we had relative to the debt ceiling.
And by the way, all the stuff that I've done—we've done—guess how much we've—how much it's raised the debt. We've cut the debt $1.7 trillion. More than any President ever has.
And so we have a good story to tell, but we got to tell it. And I was asked by the press some—I forget who asked me today—that: ""Why are you just starting this extensive drive now?"" Well, the reason we're starting now is because no one knew what the hell we passed. No one knew—they knew we passed it. They thought the idea was good.
[An airplane flew overhead.]
That's Trump. He always flies over. [Laughter] I'm teasing. That's a bad joke. Bad joke.
But all kidding aside, think about it. We—I had to spend the first—everybody told me I couldn't pass any of this stuff. We got it all. We got more major legislation passed than anybody since Roosevelt. I mean, for real. Fundamental changes in economic and foreign policy—not because of me—because I have great staff, and I got a lot of support.
But here's the second point. The second point is the reason I'm pushing it so hard now is, people know generically what's happened, and they think it's important—and overwhelming support for everything we passed by the public—but they don't know what it means in their own home, in their own neighborhoods.
So, for example, if you ever take Amtrak to New York from here, well, guess what? You go through a tunnel that was—hadn't had anything done to it since 1907. I'm probably the only non-Amtrak—I've traveled 1,200,000 miles on Amtrak, for real. Because I—after my wife and daughter were killed, I didn't plan on staying. I started to commute.
And I had the dubious distinction of being listed as the poorest man in Congress for 38 years—36 years. I didn't think I was poor. I had—I had a good Senate salary. I thought I was fine. But I was the poorest guy, literally.
And so I could not afford a house in Washington and in Wilmington, and I sold my house—I have a nice house in Wilmington. If I sold it, I'd be gone. If you leave Wilmington—if you leave Delaware, you might as well forget it. Okay?
So one day we're getting on a train, and the—and the—when I was Vice President, and the Secret Service never liked me riding the train because it's more dangerous. You can—you know, they have 99 chance of doing something bad.
And so I'm getting on the train to go home and see my mom, who was living with me, who was dying. And I get in the train, and the guy—I won't mention his name because I mentioned it last time, and he was so proud I—but I didn't mention others, so I won't mention this time. And this guy walks up to me—I've known from a time I was—started riding the train. He goes, ""Joey, baby!"" And grabs my cheek. And I thought Secret Service was going to shoot him. [Laughter] I said, ""No""—I'm serious. Am I joking about how they—my friends in Amtrak?
I had picnics in my house for all the Amtrak conductors, because they were so damn good to me all the years. No, I really mean it.
He said: ""I just read in the paper: You traveled 1 million 100 thousand""—or I think it was 1,100,000 miles—""on Air Force planes."" We have to list every—they keep a record of every time we're in an Air Force plane. And he said, ""Big effing deal, Joey."" [Laughter]
And I said—I said, ""Ange, what's the problem?"" He said, ""Joey, we just had a retirement dinner up in Newark."" He said, ""And we checked—we checked it out. You've traveled 1,200,000 miles."" [Laughter] I said, ""How'd you get that, Ange?"" He said: ""Well, we figured it out. You were in session about 117 days year-end average, times that by 36 years, then times the time as vice president. You've traveled over 1,200,000. I don't want to hear any more of this!"" [Laughter]
Well, everybody thinks every time I mention Amtrak I'm—you know—but we got $45 billion more for Amtrak—[applause]—because here's the deal: If you want to have an impact on the environment, get vehicles off the road.
And guess what? All the data shows—not a joke—if somebody can go from point A to point B on a railroad and get there quicker than they can in their car, they—they don't drive their car. They don't drive their car.
And so, for example, the Baltimore tunnel, it's going to cost a billion dollars to fix it. Had nothing been done to it since 1906, I think it was.
I'm probably the only non-Amtrak guy that's ever walked through that tunnel. For real. Walked—light bulbs hanging from the—you know, like—like in a—cords in a light bulb hanging from the ceiling, flooding going on when it rains real hard. It's under the bay. Not flooding—wipe out the track. But trains have to go through there, if my memory is correct now, at 30 miles an hour. And some of them aren't stopping in Baltimore; they're going through.
Well, guess what? We're fixing it for safety reasons, but in addition to that, you're going to be able to go through that tunnel at 100 miles an hour, fundamentally saving time. Same with New York. It's a lot of money. It's over—going to be—cost a billion dollars out of the—out of the fund we have for—for infrastructure.
But guess what? It's creating thousands of good-paying jobs, generating economic growth in downtown Baltimore.
And I said when I passed this legislation, I was going to be a President for all people, whether they voted for me or not.
Well, guess what? A guy I'm friendly with, we get on well, is the Senator—he's smart as hell—the Senator from Kentucky, Mitch Landrieu. They've been trying to fix that bridge forever——
[The audio was briefly distorted.]
——walls going to collapse. And you see the bridge collapses that are going on? Okay. And guess what it cost to rebuild that bridge: close to $1 billion.
More rail traffic and more truck traffic goes over that bridge than almost any bridge in the country, and it connects an entire economic system going all the way down to Florida. Well, we're going to build it. We're going to build it. Again, it's going to be a boom for Kentucky and Missouri, but that's a good thing, not a bad thing.
And so I guess my point is this: The reason we're doing what we're doing now is letting people know exactly what's happening, what's going to happen.
We had an event yesterday—and I'll end with this. We're replacing every single, solitary lead pipe in America. Hear me? Children are—fewer children are going to die and have mental illness. Every single lead pipe to the house—to the house—it costs them money. And we're going to make sure they have—those lead pipes are fixed.
In addition to that, we announced yesterday we're spending billions of dollars for high-speed internet that's cheap. And it's going to fundamentally change what happens in communities.
In many communities, you can't even—how many people you've—you've heard that work for you said, ""I had to stop at McDonald's with my kid to do their homework so I could pick up the internet""? I'm being deadly earnest.
How many farmers without access to internet know when the best time to sell their cattle is or their crop? They have to rely on the big conglomerates.
So it's going to fundamentally change how we think of ourselves. And it's going to up the ability of ordinary families to have access to more information and grow.
So the only point I'm making is, there is a lot we're doing. And we still cut the deficit by $1.7 billion, doing every one of these things. And I think if the Republican—and by the way, this is not your father's Republican Party. A lot of really good Republicans I've worked with. I've had seven of them—the press heard me say this—individually—well, in one case, two came to me, but in the other case, one at a time—I promised I'd never say their names, and I'll go to my grave without mentioning it—saying, ""Joe, I agree with you""—I give my word—""I agree with you, Joe. But if I—if I join you, they'll primary, and I'm going to lose my election. I'll lose my election."" Not a statement of courage, but a statement of reality.
So we've got to change all of this. And I think we're in the process of doing it, because I only have faith in the American people.
You know, I'm always quoting Irish poets on the floor of the Senate, and they always kid me about it, and they thought I was doing it because I'm Irish. It's not the reason. They're the best poets in the world. [Laughter]
And there's a guy named Seamus Heaney. I've become friends with his wife. He—I just knew him vaguely. And he wrote a poem called ""The Cure at Troy."" And the line in the poem goes—he said: ""All is changed, changed utterly. A terrible beauty has been born."" All has changed, internationally and nationally. And we can—I am more optimistic about our ability to control everything from the environment to all the things we're talking about and put them in a better place than before.
I really—I honest to God believe it. And I know—and the one thing I can say: I've been around longer than anybody. I don't brag about that very often. But all kidding aside, I think we can do great things. I really do. I really do.
And so, with your help, I hope to be able to do that. And you're helping—by the way, the money raised here is significant. You're helping a great deal. I want to thank our host and all of you. And many of you, it's a second or third time. You've got to blame yourself now, not me. [Laughter]
But you—but you know—anyway, thank you, thank you, thank you.
[Music began to play.]
White House aide. We have closed the roads—[inaudible].
The President. Last thing. If I don't leave, we lose thousands of votes. You think I'm joking? We set a time when we come—we have to give the local officials a time we are going to be leaving on the road. Since I've become President, a lot different than—I had lunch with Barack today, who was helping me. It was—and he was remarking how much he—I have 80-something vehicles that follow me. [Laughter]
And I used to think we had—we had traffic problems on the highway. I don't know what the hell is the matter. We have no problems. [Laughter] None at all. But we also make a hell of a lot of people mad if we don't get going, because they're—they block the roads beginning now.
So thank you, thank you, thank you. And thank you, Mr. Ambassador.
